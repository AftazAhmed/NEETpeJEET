Strict protection of these hotspots could reduce the ongoing mass extinctions by almost 30 per cent.<br><br>3. In India ecologically unique and biodiversity rich regions are legally protected as biosphere reserves, national parks and sanctuaries.<br><br>4. India now has 14 biosphere reserves, 90 national parks and 448 wildlife sanctuaries.<br><br>5. India has a history of religious and cultural traditions that emphasised protection of nature.<br><br>6. In many cultures tracts of forest were set aside and all the trees and wildlife within were venerated and given total protection.<br><br>7. Such sacred groves are found in Khasi and Jaintia Hills in Meghalaya.<br><br>8. Sacred groves are found in Aravalli Hills of Rajasthan.<br><br>9. Sacred groves are found in Western Ghat regions of Karnataka and Maharashtra.<br><br>10. Sacred groves are found in the Sarguja, Chanda and Bastar areas of Madhya Pradesh.<br><br>11. In Meghalaya the sacred groves are the last refuges for a large number of rare and threatened plants.<br><br>12. In ex situ conservation threatened animals and plants are taken out from their natural habitat and placed in special setting where they can be protected and given special care.<br><br>13. Zoological parks, botanical gardens and wildlife safari parks serve the purpose of ex situ conservation.<br><br>14. There are many animals that have become extinct in the wild but continue to be maintained in zoological parks.<br><br>15. In recent years ex situ conservation has advanced beyond keeping threatened species in enclosures.<br><br>16. Gametes of threatened species can be preserved in viable and fertile condition for long periods using cryopreservation techniques.<br><br>17. Eggs can be fertilised in vitro in advanced ex situ conservation.<br><br>18. Plants can be propagated using tissue culture methods in ex situ conservation.<br><br>19. Seeds of different genetic strains of commercially important plants can be kept for long periods in seed banks.<br><br>20. Biodiversity knows no political boundaries and its conservation is therefore a collective responsibility of all nations.<br><br>21. The historic Convention on Biological Diversity is also known as The Earth Summit.<br><br>22. The Earth Summit was held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.<br><br>23. The Earth Summit called upon all nations to take appropriate measures for conservation of biodiversity and sustainable utilisation of its benefits.<br><br>24. The World Summit on Sustainable Development was held in 2002 in Johannesburg South Africa as a follow-up to the Earth Summit.<br><br>25. 190 countries pledged their commitment at the World Summit on Sustainable Development.<br><br>26.
