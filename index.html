Sewage treatment is carried out in two stages: primary and secondary treatment.<br><br>3. Primary treatment steps involve physical removal of particles from sewage.<br><br>4. Both large and small particles are removed through filtration and sedimentation.<br><br>5. In primary treatment, floating debris is removed by sequential filtration.<br><br>6. Grit (soil and small pebbles) are removed by sedimentation in primary treatment.<br><br>7. All solids that settle form the primary sludge.<br><br>8. The supernatant forms the effluent after primary treatment.<br><br>9. The effluent from primary settling tank is taken for secondary treatment.<br><br>10. Secondary treatment is also called biological treatment.<br><br>11. Primary effluent is passed into large aeration tanks during secondary treatment.<br><br>12. In aeration tanks, effluent is constantly agitated mechanically.<br><br>13. Air is pumped into aeration tanks during secondary treatment.<br><br>14. This allows vigorous growth of useful aerobic microbes into flocs.<br><br>15. Flocs are masses of bacteria associated with fungal filaments to form mesh-like structures.<br><br>16. Growing microbes consume the major part of organic matter in the effluent.<br><br>17. This significantly reduces the BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) of the effluent.<br><br>18. BOD refers to the amount of oxygen consumed if all organic matter in one litre of water were oxidised by bacteria.<br><br>19. Sewage water is treated till the BOD is reduced.<br><br>20.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Microbes play a major role in treating millions of gallons of waste water everyday across the globe.<br><br>2. The methodology of microbial sewage treatment has been practiced for more than a century now.<br><br>3. This methodology is practiced in almost all parts of the world.<br><br>4. Till date, no man-made technology has been able to rival the microbial treatment of sewage.<br><br>5. Due to increasing urbanisation, sewage is being produced in much larger quantities than ever before.<br><br>6. The number of sewage treatment plants has not increased enough to treat such large quantities.<br><br>7. Untreated sewage is often discharged directly into rivers leading to their pollution.<br><br>8. Direct discharge of untreated sewage increases water-borne diseases.<br><br>9. The Ministry of Environment and Forests has initiated Ganga Action Plan and Yamuna Action Plan.<br><br>10. These plans aim to save these major rivers of our country from pollution.<br><br>11. Under these plans, it is proposed to build a large number of sewage treatment plants.<br><br>12. Only treated sewage may be discharged in the rivers under these plans.<br><br>13. Biogas is a mixture of gases containing predominantly methane.<br><br>14. Biogas is produced by the microbial activity and may be used as fuel.<br><br>15. Microbes produce different types of gaseous end-products during growth and metabolism.<br><br>16. The type of gas produced depends upon the microbes and the organic substrates they utilise.<br><br>17. In fermentation of dough, cheese-making and production of beverages, the main gas produced was CO2.<br><br>18. Certain bacteria grow anaerobically on cellulosic material.<br><br>19. These bacteria produce large amount of methane along with CO2 and H2.<br><br>20. These bacteria are collectively called methanogens.<br><br>21. Methanobacterium is one such common methanogenic bacterium.<br><br>22. Methanogens are commonly found in the anaerobic sludge during sewage treatment.<br><br>23. Methanogens are also present in the rumen (a part of stomach) of cattle.<br><br>24. A lot of cellulosic material present in the food of cattle is also present in the rumen.<br><br>25. In rumen, these bacteria help in the breakdown of cellulose.<br><br>26. These bacteria play an important role in the nutrition of cattle.<br><br>27. Human beings are not able to digest the cellulose present in our foods.<br><br>28. The excreta or dung of cattle, commonly called gobar, is rich in these bacteria.<br><br>29. Dung can be used for generation of biogas, commonly called gobar gas.<br><br>30. The biogas plant consists of a concrete tank 10 to 15 feet deep.<br><br>31. In biogas plant, bio-wastes are collected and a slurry of dung is fed.<br><br>32. A floating cover is placed over the concrete tank in biogas plant."],

There are problems associated with the overuse of chemical fertilisers.<br><br>3. There is a large pressure to switch to organic farming using biofertilisers.<br><br>4. Biofertilisers are organisms that enrich the nutrient quality of the soil.<br><br>5. The main sources of biofertilisers are bacteria, fungi and cyanobacteria.<br><br>6. Nodules on roots of leguminous plants are formed by symbiotic association of Rhizobium.<br><br>7. Rhizobium bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen into organic forms.<br><br>8. The organic forms of nitrogen are used by the plant as nutrient.<br><br>9. Other bacteria can fix atmospheric nitrogen while free-living in the soil.<br><br>10. Azospirillum and Azotobacter are examples of free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria.<br><br>11. These free-living bacteria enrich the nitrogen content of the soil.<br><br>12. Fungi form symbiotic associations with plants called mycorrhiza.<br><br>13. Many members of the genus Glomus form mycorrhiza.<br><br>14. The fungal symbiont in mycorrhiza absorbs phosphorus from soil.<br><br>15. The fungal symbiont passes phosphorus to the plant.<br><br>16. Plants having mycorrhizal associations show other benefits also.<br><br>17. Benefits include resistance to root-borne pathogens.<br><br>18. Benefits include tolerance to salinity and drought.<br><br>19. Benefits include an overall increase in plant growth and development.<br><br>20. Cyanobacteria are autotrophic microbes widely distributed in aquatic and terrestrial environments.<br><br>21. Many cyanobacteria can fix atmospheric nitrogen.<br><br>22. Examples of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria are Anabaena, Nostoc and Oscillatoria.<br><br>23. In paddy fields, cyanobacteria serve as an important biofertiliser.<br><br>24.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Restriction enzymes are called molecular scissors because they cut DNA at specific locations.<br><br>2. Plasmid DNA acts as vectors to transfer pieces of DNA attached to it into host organisms.<br><br>3. Mosquito acts as vector for malarial parasite into human body, similarly plasmid can be used as vector to deliver alien DNA.<br><br>4. The linking of antibiotic resistance gene with plasmid vector became possible with the enzyme DNA ligase.<br><br>5. DNA ligase acts to cut DNA molecules and join their ends.<br><br>6. A new combination of circular autonomously replicating DNA created in vitro is known as recombinant DNA.<br><br>7. When recombinant DNA is transferred into Escherichia coli, it replicates using the new host DNA polymerase enzyme and makes multiple copies.<br><br>8. The ability to multiply copies of antibiotic resistance gene in E. coli was called cloning of antibiotic resistance gene.<br><br>9. There are three basic steps in genetically modifying an organism: identification of DNA with desirable genes, introduction of identified DNA into host, and maintenance of introduced DNA in host and transfer to progeny.<br><br>10. The key tools for recombinant DNA technology are restriction enzymes, polymerase enzymes, ligases, vectors and the host organism.<br><br>11. In 1963, two enzymes responsible for restricting the growth of bacteriophage in Escherichia coli were isolated.<br><br>12. One enzyme added methyl groups to DNA while the other cut DNA and was called restriction endonuclease.<br><br>13. The first restriction endonuclease Hind II was isolated and characterized five years later in 1968.<br><br>14. Hind II cuts out DNA molecules at a particular point by recognising a specific sequence of six base pairs.<br><br>15. The specific base sequence recognised by restriction enzyme is known as the recognition sequence.<br><br>16. More than 900 restriction enzymes have been isolated from over 230 strains of bacteria.<br><br>17. Each restriction enzyme recognises different recognition sequences.<br><br>18. The naming convention for restriction enzymes: first letter comes from genus, second two letters come from species of prokaryotic cell.<br><br>19.

Pure DNA fragments cannot be seen in visible light without staining.<br><br>10. Bright orange coloured bands of DNA are seen in ethidium bromide stained gel exposed to UV light.<br><br>11. The separated bands of DNA are cut out from the agarose gel and extracted from the gel piece.<br><br>12. The process of cutting out and extracting DNA bands from agarose gel is known as elution.<br><br>13. DNA fragments purified by elution are used in constructing recombinant DNA by joining them with cloning vectors.<br><br>14. Plasmids and bacteriophages have the ability to replicate within bacterial cells independent of the control of chromosomal DNA.<br><br>15. Bacteriophages have very high copy numbers of their genome within the bacterial cell because of their high number per cell.<br><br>16. Some plasmids may have only one or two copies per cell whereas others may have 15-100 copies per cell.<br><br>17. The copy numbers of plasmids can go even higher than 100 copies per cell.<br><br>18. If we link an alien piece of DNA with bacteriophage or plasmid DNA, we can multiply its numbers equal to the copy number of the plasmid or bacteriophage.<br><br>19. Cloning vectors are engineered in such a way that they help easy linking of foreign DNA.<br><br>20. Cloning vectors help in selection of recombinants from non-recombinants."],

In biolistics or gene gun method suitable for plants, cells are bombarded with high velocity micro-particles of gold or tungsten coated with DNA.<br><br>5. Disarmed pathogen vectors when allowed to infect the cell transfer the recombinant DNA into the host.<br><br>6. Recombinant DNA technology involves several steps in specific sequence such as isolation of DNA, fragmentation of DNA by restriction endonucleases, isolation of desired DNA fragment, ligation of DNA fragment into vector, transferring recombinant DNA into host, culturing host cells at large scale and extraction of desired product.<br><br>7. Nucleic acid is the genetic material of all organisms without exception and in majority of organisms this is deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA.<br><br>8. To cut DNA with restriction enzymes, it needs to be in pure form free from other macro-molecules.<br><br>9. Since DNA is enclosed within membranes, we have to break the cell open to release DNA along with other macromolecules such as RNA, proteins, polysaccharides and lipids.<br><br>10. Bacterial cells can be treated with lysozyme enzyme to break cell walls and release DNA.<br><br>11. Plant tissue can be treated with cellulase enzyme to break cell walls and release DNA.<br><br>12. Fungal cells can be treated with chitinase enzyme to break cell walls and release DNA.<br><br>13. Genes are located on long molecules of DNA interwound with proteins such as histones.<br><br>14. RNA can be removed from DNA preparation by treatment with ribonuclease enzyme.<br><br>15. Proteins can be removed from DNA preparation by treatment with protease enzyme.<br><br>16. Other molecules can be removed by appropriate treatments and purified DNA ultimately precipitates out after the addition of chilled ethanol.<br><br>17. Precipitated DNA can be seen as collection of fine threads in the suspension.<br><br>18. Treatment with divalent cation such as calcium increases efficiency with which DNA enters bacterium through pores in its cell wall.<br><br>19. Microinjection is used to transform animal cells while biolistics or gene gun is used to transform plant cells.<br><br>20. The processes facilitating recombinant DNA technology include specific tools and sequential steps for constructing and transferring recombinant DNA."],

The Green Revolution succeeded in tripling the food supply but was still insufficient to feed the growing human population.<br><br>3. Increased yields during Green Revolution were mainly due to improved crop varieties, better management practices, and use of agrochemicals like fertilisers and pesticides.<br><br>4. Agrochemicals are often too expensive for farmers in developing countries limiting their accessibility.<br><br>5. Further increases in yield with existing varieties are not possible using conventional breeding methods alone.<br><br>6. Traditional breeding techniques failed to provide sufficiently fast and efficient systems for crop improvement.<br><br>7. Tissue culture technology was developed during the 1950s when scientists learnt that whole plants could be regenerated from explants.<br><br>8. An explant is any part of a plant taken out and grown in a test tube under sterile conditions in special nutrient media.<br><br>9. Totipotency is the capacity to generate a whole plant from any cell or explant.<br><br>10. The nutrient medium in tissue culture must provide a carbon source such as sucrose along with inorganic salts, vitamins, amino acids and growth regulators.<br><br>11. Growth regulators like auxins and cytokinins are essential components of tissue culture nutrient medium.<br><br>12. Micro-propagation is the method of producing thousands of plants through tissue culture in short durations.<br><br>13. Plants produced through tissue culture are genetically identical to the original plant and are called somaclones.<br><br>14. Important food plants like tomato, banana, and apple have been produced on commercial scale using micro-propagation.<br><br>15. Recovery of healthy plants from diseased plants is an important application of tissue culture method.<br><br>16. Even if a plant is infected with a virus, the meristem including apical and axillary regions remains free of virus.<br><br>17. Virus-free plants can be obtained by removing the meristem and growing it in vitro conditions.<br><br>18. Scientists have succeeded in culturing meristems of banana, sugarcane, and potato for virus-free plant production.<br><br>19. Protoplasts are naked plant cells surrounded only by plasma membranes after digestion of their cell walls.<br><br>20. Scientists have isolated single cells from plants and digested their cell walls to obtain isolated protoplasts.<br><br>21. Isolated protoplasts from two different plant varieties with desirable characters can be fused to get hybrid protoplasts.<br><br>22. Hybrid protoplasts can be further grown to form a new plant with combined desirable traits.<br><br>23.

Ecology can be studied at various levels of biological organization including organisms, populations, communities and biomes.<br><br>3. Population ecology specifically explores ecological processes at the population level.<br><br>4. A population consists of individuals of a species living in a well defined geographical area, sharing or competing for similar resources, and potentially interbreeding.<br><br>5. Although interbreeding implies sexual reproduction, groups formed through asexual reproduction can also be called populations for ecological studies.<br><br>6. Examples of populations include cormorants in a wetland, rats in an abandoned dwelling, teak wood trees in a forest tract, bacteria in a culture plate, and lotus plants in a pond.<br><br>7. Natural selection operates at the population level to evolve desired traits, even though individual organisms must cope with environmental changes.<br><br>8. Population ecology is important because it links ecology to population genetics and evolution.<br><br>9. A population has certain attributes that an individual organism does not possess.<br><br>10. An individual may have births and deaths, but a population has birth rates and death rates.<br><br>11. Birth rates and death rates in a population refer to per capita births and deaths respectively.<br><br>12. Population rates are expressed as changes in numbers with respect to members of the population.<br><br>13. Birth rate calculation example: If 20 lotus plants produced 8 new plants, the birth rate is 8 divided by 20 equals 0.4 offspring per lotus per year.<br><br>14. Death rate calculation example: If 4 out of 40 fruitflies died in one week, the death rate is 4 divided by 40 equals 0.1 individuals per fruitfly per week.<br><br>15. Sex ratio is a population attribute that indicates the proportion of males and females in the population.<br><br>16. An individual can be either male or female, but a population has a sex ratio such as 60 per cent females and 40 per cent males.<br><br>17. A population at any given time is composed of individuals of different ages.<br><br>18. Age distribution is plotted as per cent individuals of a given age or age group for the population.<br><br>19. The age distribution structure when plotted is called the age pyramid.<br><br>20.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Predators help in maintaining species diversity in a community by reducing the intensity of competition among competing prey species.<br><br>2. In the rocky intertidal communities of the American Pacific Coast, the starfish Pisaster is an important predator.<br><br>3. In a field experiment, when all the starfish were removed from an enclosed intertidal area, more than 10 species of invertebrates became extinct within a year because of inter-specific competition.<br><br>4. If a predator is too efficient and overexploits its prey, then the prey might become extinct and following it, the predator will also become extinct for lack of food.<br><br>5. This is the reason why predators in nature are prudent.<br><br>6. Prey species have evolved various defenses to lessen the impact of predation.<br><br>7. Some species of insects and frogs are cryptically-coloured or camouflaged to avoid being detected easily by the predator.<br><br>8. Some prey species are poisonous and therefore avoided by the predators.<br><br>9. The Monarch butterfly is highly distasteful to its predator (bird) because of a special chemical present in its body.<br><br>10. Interestingly, the Monarch butterfly acquires this chemical during its caterpillar stage by feeding on a poisonous weed.<br><br>11. For plants, herbivores are the predators.<br><br>12. Nearly 25 per cent of all insects are known to be phytophagous, feeding on plant sap and other parts of plants.<br><br>13. The problem of herbivory is particularly severe for plants because, unlike animals, they cannot run away from their predators.<br><br>14. Plants therefore have evolved an astonishing variety of morphological and chemical defences against herbivores.<br><br>15. Thorns in Acacia and Cactus are the most common morphological means of defence against herbivores.<br><br>16. Many plants produce and store chemicals that make the herbivore sick when they are eaten, inhibit feeding or digestion, disrupt its reproduction or even kill it.<br><br>17. The weed Calotropis growing in abandoned fields produces highly poisonous cardiac glycosides.<br><br>18. That is why you never see any cattle or goats browsing on Calotropis plant.<br><br>19. A wide variety of chemical substances that we extract from plants on a commercial scale such as nicotine, caffeine, quinine, strychnine, opium, etc., are produced by them actually as defences against grazers and browsers.<br><br>20. When Darwin spoke of the struggle for existence and survival of the fittest in nature, he was convinced that interspecific competition is a potent force in organic evolution.<br><br>21. It is generally believed that competition occurs when closely related species compete for the same resources that are limiting, but this is not entirely true.<br><br>22. Firstly, totally unrelated species could also compete for the same resource.<br><br>23. For instance, in some shallow South American lakes, visiting flamingoes and resident fishes compete for their common food, the zooplankton in the lake."],

Of the incident solar radiation less than 50 per cent of it is photosynthetically active radiation (PAR).<br><br>3. Plants and photosynthetic bacteria (autotrophs) fix suns radiant energy to make food from simple inorganic materials.<br><br>4. Plants capture only 2-10 per cent of the PAR and this small amount of energy sustains the entire living world.<br><br>5. Solar energy captured by plants flows through different organisms of an ecosystem.<br><br>6. All organisms are dependent for their food on producers either directly or indirectly.<br><br>7. There is unidirectional flow of energy from the sun to producers and then to consumers.<br><br>8. Ecosystems need a constant supply of energy to synthesise the molecules they require to counteract the universal tendency toward increasing disorderliness.<br><br>9. The green plant in the ecosystem are called producers.<br><br>10. In a terrestrial ecosystem the major producers are herbaceous and woody plants.<br><br>11. Producers in an aquatic ecosystem are various species like phytoplankton, algae and higher plants.<br><br>12. Starting from the plants or producers, food chains or rather webs are formed such that an animal feeds on a plant or on another animal and in turn is food for another.<br><br>13. The concept of food chain is based on interdependency of organisms for food.<br><br>14. No energy that is trapped into an organism remains in it for ever.<br><br>15. The energy trapped by the producer is either passed on to a consumer or the organism dies.<br><br>16. Death of organism is the beginning of the detritus food chain or web.<br><br>17. All animals depend on plants directly or indirectly for their food needs and are hence called herbivores and also heterotrophs.<br><br>18. Animals that feed on the producers (plants) are called primary consumers.<br><br>19. Animals that eat other animals which in turn eat the plants or their produce are called secondary consumers.<br><br>20. Tertiary consumers are also present in food chains.<br><br>21. The primary consumers are herbivores.<br><br>22. Some common herbivores are insects, birds and mammals in terrestrial ecosystem and molluscs in aquatic ecosystem.<br><br>23. The consumers that feed on herbivores are carnivores or more correctly primary carnivores though secondary consumers.<br><br>24.

According to May's global estimates, only 22 per cent of the total species have been recorded so far.<br><br>6. Applying May's proportion to India's diversity, there are probably more than 1,00,000 plant species yet to be discovered and described.<br><br>7. More than 3,00,000 animal species are estimated to be yet undiscovered and described in India.<br><br>8. The immense trained manpower in the form of taxonomists and the time required make it difficult to compile the complete inventory of biological wealth.<br><br>9. A large fraction of species faces the threat of becoming extinct even before we discover them.<br><br>10. The loss of undiscovered species is metaphorically described as Nature's giant library burning even before we catalogued the titles of all the books stocked there.<br><br>11. The diversity of plants and animals is not uniform throughout the world but shows a rather uneven distribution.<br><br>12. The most well-known pattern in biodiversity is the latitudinal gradient in diversity.<br><br>13. Species diversity decreases as we move away from the equator towards the poles in general.<br><br>14. With very few exceptions, tropics with latitudinal range of 23.5 degree N to 23.5 degree S harbour more species than temperate or polar regions.<br><br>15. Colombia located near the equator has nearly 1,400 species of birds.<br><br>16. New York at 41 degree N has 105 species of birds.<br><br>17. Greenland at 71 degree N has only 56 species of birds.<br><br>18. India with much of its land area in tropical latitudes has more than 1,200 species of birds.<br><br>19. A forest in a tropical region like Equador has up to 10 times as many species of vascular plants as a forest of equal area in a temperate region like the Midwest of the USA.<br><br>20. The largely tropical Amazonian rain forest in South America has the greatest biodiversity on earth.<br><br>21. The Amazonian rain forest is home to more than 40,000 species of plants.<br><br>22. The Amazonian rain forest contains 3,000 species of fishes.<br><br>23. The Amazonian rain forest has 1,300 species of birds.<br><br>24. The Amazonian rain forest has 427 species of mammals.<br><br>25. The Amazonian rain forest has 427 species of amphibians.<br><br>26. The Amazonian rain forest has 378 species of reptiles.<br><br>27. The Amazonian rain forest contains of the order of 1,25,000 invertebrates.<br><br>28. Scientists estimate that in Amazonian rain forests there might be at least two million insect species waiting to be discovered and named.<br><br>29. Ecologists and evolutionary biologists have proposed various hypotheses to explain greater tropical biodiversity.<br><br>30. One important hypothesis states that speciation is generally a function of time.<br><br>31. Unlike temperate regions subjected to frequent glaciations in the past, tropical latitudes have remained relatively undisturbed for millions of years.<br><br>32. Tropical latitudes have had a long evolutionary time which contributes to their greater biodiversity."],

As more and more rivets are removed, the plane becomes dangerously weak over a period of time.<br><br>16. Which rivet is removed may also be critical in the rivet popper hypothesis.<br><br>17. Loss of rivets on the wings represents loss of key species that drive major ecosystem functions.<br><br>18. Loss of rivets on wings is a more serious threat to flight safety than loss of rivets on seats or windows inside the plane.<br><br>19. It is doubtful if any new species are being added through speciation into the earth's treasury of species.<br><br>20. There is no doubt about the continuing losses of species.<br><br>21. The biological wealth of our planet has been declining rapidly.<br><br>22. The accusing finger for biodiversity loss is clearly pointing to human activities.<br><br>23. The colonisation of tropical Pacific islands is said to have led to the extinction of more than 2,000 species of native birds.<br><br>24. The IUCN Red List 2004 documents the extinction of 784 species in total.<br><br>25. The 784 extinct species include 338 vertebrates, 359 invertebrates and 87 plants.<br><br>26. These extinctions documented in IUCN Red List 2004 occurred in the last five hundred years.<br><br>27. Examples of recent extinctions include the dodo from Mauritius.<br><br>28. The quagga from Africa is an example of recent extinction.<br><br>29. The thylacine from Australia is an example of recent extinction.<br><br>30. Steller's Sea Cow from Russia is an example of recent extinction.<br><br>31. Three subspecies of tiger - Bali, Javan, and Caspian - have gone extinct.<br><br>32.
