At the 3 prime-end of polynucleotide chain the sugar has a free OH of 3 prime C group.<br><br>3. The backbone of polynucleotide chain is due to sugar and phosphates.<br><br>4. The nitrogenous bases linked to sugar moiety project from the backbone.<br><br>5. In RNA every nucleotide has an additional OH group present at 2 prime position in the ribose.<br><br>6. In RNA uracil is found at the place of thymine.<br><br>7. 5-methyl uracil is another chemical name for thymine.<br><br>8. DNA as an acidic substance present in nucleus was first identified by Friedrich Miescher in 1869.<br><br>9. Friedrich Miescher named the acidic substance found in nucleus as Nuclein.<br><br>10. Due to technical limitation in isolating such a long polymer intact the elucidation of structure of DNA remained elusive for a very long period.<br><br>11. In 1953 James Watson and Francis Crick proposed the Double Helix model for the structure of DNA.<br><br>12. Watson and Crick based their model on X-ray diffraction data produced by Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin.<br><br>13. One of the hallmarks of Watson and Crick proposition was base pairing between the two strands of polynucleotide chains.<br><br>14. Erwin Chargaff observed that for a double stranded DNA the ratios between Adenine and Thymine and Guanine and Cytosine are constant and equals one.<br><br>15. The base pairing confers a very unique property to the polynucleotide chains making them complementary to each other.<br><br>16. If the sequence of bases in one strand is known then the sequence in other strand can be predicted.<br><br>17. If each strand from a parental DNA acts as a template for synthesis of a new strand the two daughter DNA produced would be identical to the parental DNA molecule.<br><br>18. Because of the complementary nature of DNA strands the genetic implications of the structure of DNA became very clear.<br><br>19. The Double Helix structure of DNA is made of two polynucleotide chains where the backbone is constituted by sugar-phosphate and the bases project inside.<br><br>20. The two chains of DNA have anti-parallel polarity meaning if one chain has the polarity 5 prime to 3 prime the other has 3 prime to 5 prime.<br><br>21. The bases in two strands are paired through hydrogen bonds forming base pairs.<br><br>22. Adenine forms two hydrogen bonds with Thymine from opposite strand and vice-versa.<br><br>23. Guanine is bonded with Cytosine with three H-bonds.<br><br>24. Always a purine comes opposite to a pyrimidine in DNA base pairing.<br><br>25. The purine-pyrimidine base pairing generates approximately uniform distance between the two strands of the helix.<br><br>26. The two chains of DNA are coiled in a right-handed fashion.<br><br>27. The pitch of the DNA helix is 3.4 nm.<br><br>28. A nanometre is one billionth of a metre that is 10 raised to power negative 9 m.<br><br>29.

Analogy refers to a situation exactly opposite to homology.<br><br>4. Wings of butterfly and of birds look alike but they are not anatomically similar structures though they perform similar functions.<br><br>5. Analogous structures are a result of convergent evolution.<br><br>6. Convergent evolution involves different structures evolving for the same function and hence having similarity.<br><br>7. Other examples of analogy are the eye of the octopus and of mammals.<br><br>8. Flippers of Penguins and Dolphins are examples of analogous structures.<br><br>9.

Members of a population vary in characteristics even though they look superficially similar.<br><br>13. Most of variations in a population are inherited.<br><br>14. Theoretically population size will grow exponentially if everybody reproduced maximally.<br><br>15. The fact that population sizes in reality are limited means that there had been competition for resources.<br><br>16. Only some organisms survived and grew at the cost of others that could not flourish.<br><br>17. Darwin asserted that variations which are heritable and which make resource utilisation better will enable only those to reproduce and leave more progeny.<br><br>18. Over many generations, survivors will leave more progeny and there would be a change in population characteristic.<br><br>19. Hence new forms appear to arise over many generations.<br><br>20. Mendel had talked of inheritable factors influencing phenotype.<br><br>21. Darwin either ignored Mendel observations or kept silence.<br><br>22. Hugo deVries based on his work on evening primrose brought forth the idea of mutations.<br><br>23. Mutations are large difference arising suddenly in a population.<br><br>24. Hugo deVries believed that it is mutation which causes evolution and not the minor variations that Darwin talked about.<br><br>25. Mutations are random and directionless while Darwinian variations are small and directional.<br><br>26. Evolution for Darwin was gradual while deVries believed mutation caused speciation.<br><br>27. DeVries called mutation causing speciation as saltation which means single step large mutation.<br><br>28. Studies in population genetics later brought out some clarity about mechanism of evolution."],

Hippocrates was the early Greek physician who asserted the humor hypothesis of health.<br><br>3. Early medical thought believed that persons with blackbile belonged to hot personality and would have fevers.<br><br>4. The idea of humor-based health was arrived at by pure reflective thought without experimental evidence.<br><br>5. William Harvey discovered blood circulation using experimental method, marking a shift from reflective to evidence-based medicine.<br><br>6. The demonstration of normal body temperature in persons with blackbile using thermometer disproved the good humor hypothesis of health.<br><br>7. Thermometer was the instrument used to measure body temperature and disprove the blackbile-fever hypothesis.<br><br>8. Modern biology states that mind influences the immune system through neural system and endocrine system.<br><br>9. The immune system is responsible for maintaining our health according to current biological understanding.<br><br>10. Mental state and mind can affect our health through their influence on the immune system.<br><br>11. Health is affected by three major categories of factors - genetic disorders, infections, and lifestyle.<br><br>12. Genetic disorders include deficiencies with which a child is born and defects inherited from parents from birth.<br><br>13. Infections represent another major category of factors affecting human health.<br><br>14.

Mary Mallon continued to spread typhoid for several years through the food she prepared.<br><br>3. Widal test is a classic case in medicine associated with Mary Mallon and typhoid diagnosis.<br><br>4. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae bacteria are responsible for pneumonia in humans.<br><br>5. Pneumonia infection affects the alveoli or air filled sacs of the lungs.<br><br>6. In pneumonia, the alveoli get filled with fluid leading to severe problems in respiration.<br><br>7. Symptoms of pneumonia include fever, chills, cough and headache.<br><br>8. In severe pneumonia cases, the lips and finger nails may turn gray to bluish in colour.<br><br>9. A healthy person acquires pneumonia infection by inhaling droplets or aerosols released by infected person.<br><br>10. Pneumonia can also spread by sharing glasses and utensils with an infected person.<br><br>11. Dysentery, plague and diphtheria are other bacterial diseases in man mentioned on this page.<br><br>12. Rhino viruses represent one group of viruses which cause the most infectious human ailment - the common cold.<br><br>13. Rhino viruses infect the nose and respiratory passage but not the lungs.<br><br>14. Common cold is characterised by nasal congestion and discharge, sore throat, hoarseness, cough, headache and tiredness.<br><br>15. Common cold symptoms usually last for 3-7 days.<br><br>16. Common cold droplets from cough or sneeze of infected person are either inhaled directly or transmitted through contaminated objects.<br><br>17. Common cold can spread through contaminated pens, books, cups, doorknobs, computer keyboard or mouse.<br><br>18. Plasmodium, a tiny protozoan, is responsible for malaria disease.<br><br>19. Different species of Plasmodium including P. vivax, P. malariae and P. falciparum are responsible for different types of malaria.<br><br>20. Malignant malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum is the most serious one and can even be fatal.<br><br>21. Plasmodium enters the human body as sporozoites which is the infectious form.<br><br>22. Plasmodium sporozoites enter through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquito.<br><br>23. Plasmodium parasites initially multiply within the liver cells in humans.<br><br>24. After multiplying in liver, Plasmodium parasites attack the red blood cells resulting in their rupture.<br><br>25. The rupture of RBCs is associated with release of a toxic substance called haemozoin.<br><br>26. Haemozoin is responsible for the chill and high fever recurring every three to four days in malaria.<br><br>27. When a female Anopheles mosquito bites an infected person, parasites enter the mosquito body and undergo further development.<br><br>28. Parasites multiply within mosquito to form sporozoites that are stored in their salivary glands.<br><br>29. When mosquitoes bite a human, the sporozoites are introduced into the body, thereby initiating infection.<br><br>30.

Ascaris is the common round worm and Wuchereria is the filarial worm, both are helminths pathogenic to man.<br><br>3. Ascaris is an intestinal parasite that causes ascariasis disease in humans.<br><br>4. Symptoms of ascariasis include internal bleeding, muscular pain, fever, anaemia and blockage of the intestinal passage.<br><br>5. The eggs of Ascaris parasite are excreted along with faeces of infected persons which contaminate soil, water and plants.<br><br>6. A healthy person acquires ascariasis infection through contaminated water, vegetables and fruits.<br><br>7. Wuchereria bancrofti and W. malayi are the filarial worms that cause filariasis or elephantiasis.<br><br>8. Filarial worms cause slowly developing chronic inflammation of the organs in which they live for many years.<br><br>9. Filarial worms usually infect the lymphatic vessels of the lower limbs causing elephantiasis or filariasis.<br><br>10. The disease caused by Wuchereria is called elephantiasis or filariasis as shown in Figure 7.2.<br><br>11. The genital organs are also often affected in filariasis, resulting in gross deformities.<br><br>12. The pathogens of filariasis are transmitted to a healthy person through the bite by female mosquito vectors.<br><br>13. Fungi belonging to genera Microsporum, Trichophyton and Epidermophyton are responsible for ringworms.<br><br>14. Ringworm is one of the most common infectious diseases in man.<br><br>15. Main symptoms of ringworm include appearance of dry, scaly lesions on skin, nails and scalp as shown in Figure 7.3.<br><br>16. Ringworm lesions are accompanied by intense itching.<br><br>17. Heat and moisture help ringworm fungi to grow, making them thrive in skin folds such as groin or between toes.<br><br>18. Ringworms are generally acquired from soil or by using towels, clothes or even the comb of infected individuals.<br><br>19. Maintenance of personal and public hygiene is very important for prevention and control of many infectious diseases.<br><br>20. Measures for personal hygiene include keeping the body clean and consumption of clean drinking water, food, vegetables and fruits.<br><br>21. Public hygiene includes proper disposal of waste and excreta.<br><br>22. Public hygiene measures include periodic cleaning and disinfection of water reservoirs, pools, cesspools and tanks.<br><br>23. Observing standard practices of hygiene in public catering is an important public hygiene measure.<br><br>24. Personal and public hygiene measures are particularly essential where infectious agents are transmitted through food and water.<br><br>25. Diseases transmitted through food and water include typhoid, amoebiasis and ascariasis.<br><br>26. In cases of air-borne diseases such as pneumonia and common cold, in addition to personal and public hygiene measures, close contact precautions are needed.<br><br>27. Food products contaminated by faecal matter serve as source of infection for several diseases.<br><br>28. Helminths like Ascaris and Wuchereria are known to be pathogenic to man causing significant diseases."],

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. More than a million Indians suffer from cancer and a large number of them die from it annually.<br><br>2. Mechanisms of cancer development, treatment and control have been some of the most intense areas of research in biology and medicine.<br><br>3. In our body, cell growth and differentiation is highly controlled and regulated.<br><br>4. In cancer cells, there is breakdown of regulatory mechanisms that control cell growth and differentiation.<br><br>5. Normal cells show a property called contact inhibition by which contact with other cells inhibits their uncontrolled growth.<br><br>6. Cancer cells appear to have lost the property of contact inhibition.<br><br>7. As a result of loss of contact inhibition, cancerous cells just continue to divide giving rise to masses of cells called tumors.<br><br>8. Tumors are of two types - benign and malignant.<br><br>9. Benign tumors normally remain confined to their original location and do not spread to other parts of the body.<br><br>10. Benign tumors cause little damage to the body.<br><br>11. Malignant tumors are a mass of proliferating cells called neoplastic or tumor cells.<br><br>12. Malignant tumor cells grow very rapidly, invading and damaging the surrounding normal tissues.<br><br>13. Malignant tumor cells actively divide and grow and starve normal cells by competing for vital nutrients.<br><br>14. Cells sloughed from malignant tumors reach distant sites through blood.<br><br>15. Wherever sloughed cells get lodged in the body, they start a new tumor there.<br><br>16. The property of spreading to distant sites and starting new tumors is called metastasis.<br><br>17. Metastasis is the most feared property of malignant tumors.<br><br>18. Transformation of normal cells into cancerous neoplastic cells may be induced by physical, chemical or biological agents.<br><br>19. Agents that cause transformation of normal cells into cancer cells are called carcinogens.<br><br>20. Ionising radiations like X-rays and gamma rays cause DNA damage leading to neoplastic transformation.<br><br>21. Non-ionizing radiations like UV cause DNA damage leading to neoplastic transformation.<br><br>22. Chemical carcinogens present in tobacco smoke have been identified as a major cause of lung cancer.<br><br>23. Cancer causing viruses are called oncogenic viruses.<br><br>24. Oncogenic viruses have genes called viral oncogenes.<br><br>25. Several genes called cellular oncogenes or c-onc have been identified in normal cells.<br><br>26. Proto oncogenes are genes in normal cells which when activated under certain conditions could lead to oncogenic transformation.<br><br>27. Early detection of cancers is essential as it allows the disease to be treated successfully in many cases.<br><br>28. Cancer detection is based on biopsy and histopathological studies of the tissue.<br><br>29. Blood and bone marrow tests for increased cell counts are used in case of leukemias.<br><br>30. In biopsy, a piece of the suspected tissue is cut into thin sections, stained and examined under microscope by pathologist.<br><br>31. Examination of stained tissue sections under microscope is called histopathological studies.<br><br>32. Techniques like radiography using X-rays, CT and MRI are very useful to detect cancers of internal organs.<br><br>33. Computed tomography or CT uses X-rays to generate a three-dimensional image of the internal of an organ.<br><br>34. MRI or magnetic resonance imaging uses strong magnetic fields and non-ionising radiations.<br><br>35. MRI accurately detects pathological and physiological changes in the living tissue.<br><br>36. Antibodies against cancer-specific antigens are also used for detection of certain cancers.<br><br>37. Techniques of molecular biology can be used for cancer detection and diagnosis."],

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Smoking also paves the way to hard drugs.<br><br>2. Tobacco has been used by human beings for more than 400 years.<br><br>3. Tobacco can be smoked, chewed or used as a snuff.<br><br>4. Tobacco contains a large number of chemical substances including nicotine, an alkaloid.<br><br>5. Nicotine stimulates adrenal gland to release adrenaline and nor-adrenaline into blood circulation.<br><br>6. Adrenaline and nor-adrenaline released by nicotine stimulation raise blood pressure and increase heart rate.<br><br>7. Smoking is associated with increased incidences of cancers of lung, urinary bladder and throat.<br><br>8. Smoking is associated with bronchitis, emphysema, coronary heart disease and gastric ulcer.<br><br>9. Tobacco chewing is associated with increased risk of cancer of the oral cavity.<br><br>10. Smoking increases carbon monoxide or CO content in blood.<br><br>11. Increased carbon monoxide reduces the concentration of haembound oxygen.<br><br>12. Reduction in haembound oxygen causes oxygen deficiency in the body.<br><br>13. Cigarette packets have a statutory warning that warns against smoking.<br><br>14. The warning states both in words and pictures that smoking is injurious to health.<br><br>15. Yet smoking is very prevalent in society, both among young and old.<br><br>16. Knowing the dangers of smoking and chewing tobacco, and its addictive nature, the youth and old need to avoid these habits.<br><br>17. Any addict requires counselling and medical help to get rid of the habit.<br><br>18. Adolescence means both a period and a process during which a child becomes mature.<br><br>19. During adolescence, a child becomes mature in terms of his or her attitudes and beliefs for effective participation in society.<br><br>20. The period between 12-18 years of age may be thought of as adolescence period.<br><br>21. Adolescence is a bridge linking childhood and adulthood.<br><br>22. Adolescence is accompanied by several biological and behavioural changes.<br><br>23. Adolescence is a very vulnerable phase of mental and psychological development of an individual.<br><br>24. Curiosity, need for adventure and excitement, and experimentation constitute common causes which motivate youngsters towards drug and alcohol use.<br><br>25. A childs inquisitive curiosity motivates him or her to experiment with drugs or alcohol.<br><br>26. Effects that might be perceived as benefits of alcohol or drug use complicate experimentation.<br><br>27. The first use of drugs or alcohol may be out of curiosity or experimentation.<br><br>28. Later the child starts using drugs or alcohol to escape facing problems.<br><br>29. Of late, stress from pressures to excel in academics or examinations has played a significant role in persuading youngsters to try alcohol and drugs.<br><br>30. The perception among youth that it is cool or progressive to smoke, use drugs or alcohol is a major cause for youth to start these habits.<br><br>31. Television, movies, newspapers, internet help to promote the perception that smoking or drug use is cool.<br><br>32. Other factors associated with drug and alcohol abuse among adolescents are unstable or unsupportive family structures.<br><br>33. Peer pressure is another factor associated with drug and alcohol abuse among adolescents."],

Both large and small particles are removed through filtration and sedimentation.<br><br>5. In primary treatment, floating debris is removed by sequential filtration.<br><br>6. Grit (soil and small pebbles) are removed by sedimentation in primary treatment.<br><br>7. All solids that settle form the primary sludge.<br><br>8. The supernatant forms the effluent after primary treatment.<br><br>9. The effluent from primary settling tank is taken for secondary treatment.<br><br>10. Secondary treatment is also called biological treatment.<br><br>11. Primary effluent is passed into large aeration tanks during secondary treatment.<br><br>12. In aeration tanks, effluent is constantly agitated mechanically.<br><br>13. Air is pumped into aeration tanks during secondary treatment.<br><br>14. This allows vigorous growth of useful aerobic microbes into flocs.<br><br>15. Flocs are masses of bacteria associated with fungal filaments to form mesh-like structures.<br><br>16. Growing microbes consume the major part of organic matter in the effluent.<br><br>17. This significantly reduces the BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) of the effluent.<br><br>18. BOD refers to the amount of oxygen consumed if all organic matter in one litre of water were oxidised by bacteria.<br><br>19. Sewage water is treated till the BOD is reduced.<br><br>20.

The methodology of microbial sewage treatment has been practiced for more than a century now.<br><br>3. This methodology is practiced in almost all parts of the world.<br><br>4. Till date, no man-made technology has been able to rival the microbial treatment of sewage.<br><br>5. Due to increasing urbanisation, sewage is being produced in much larger quantities than ever before.<br><br>6. The number of sewage treatment plants has not increased enough to treat such large quantities.<br><br>7. Untreated sewage is often discharged directly into rivers leading to their pollution.<br><br>8. Direct discharge of untreated sewage increases water-borne diseases.<br><br>9. The Ministry of Environment and Forests has initiated Ganga Action Plan and Yamuna Action Plan.<br><br>10. These plans aim to save these major rivers of our country from pollution.<br><br>11. Under these plans, it is proposed to build a large number of sewage treatment plants.<br><br>12. Only treated sewage may be discharged in the rivers under these plans.<br><br>13. Biogas is a mixture of gases containing predominantly methane.<br><br>14. Biogas is produced by the microbial activity and may be used as fuel.<br><br>15. Microbes produce different types of gaseous end-products during growth and metabolism.<br><br>16. The type of gas produced depends upon the microbes and the organic substrates they utilise.<br><br>17. In fermentation of dough, cheese-making and production of beverages, the main gas produced was CO2.<br><br>18. Certain bacteria grow anaerobically on cellulosic material.<br><br>19. These bacteria produce large amount of methane along with CO2 and H2.<br><br>20. These bacteria are collectively called methanogens.<br><br>21. Methanobacterium is one such common methanogenic bacterium.<br><br>22. Methanogens are commonly found in the anaerobic sludge during sewage treatment.<br><br>23. Methanogens are also present in the rumen (a part of stomach) of cattle.<br><br>24. A lot of cellulosic material present in the food of cattle is also present in the rumen.<br><br>25. In rumen, these bacteria help in the breakdown of cellulose.<br><br>26. These bacteria play an important role in the nutrition of cattle.<br><br>27. Human beings are not able to digest the cellulose present in our foods.<br><br>28. The excreta or dung of cattle, commonly called gobar, is rich in these bacteria.<br><br>29. Dung can be used for generation of biogas, commonly called gobar gas.<br><br>30. The biogas plant consists of a concrete tank 10 to 15 feet deep.<br><br>31.

A chess board has 64 squares in total.<br><br>5. The king realized that all the wheat produced in his entire kingdom pooled together could still be inadequate to cover all the 64 squares.<br><br>6. A tiny organism reproducing by binary fission, doubling in numbers every day, would reach a mind-boggling population size in 64 days, provided food and space remain unlimited.<br><br>7. No population of any species in nature has at its disposal unlimited resources to permit exponential growth.<br><br>8. Limited resources lead to competition between individuals for limited resources.<br><br>9. Eventually, the fittest individual will survive and reproduce in populations with limited resources.<br><br>10. Governments of many countries have realized the fact of limited resources and introduced various restraints to limit human population growth.<br><br>11. In nature, a given habitat has enough resources to support a maximum possible number, beyond which no further growth is possible.<br><br>12. The limit of maximum possible number is called nature's carrying capacity, represented by K for that species in that habitat.<br><br>13. A population growing in a habitat with limited resources shows initially a lag phase.<br><br>14. The lag phase is followed by phases of acceleration and deceleration.<br><br>15. Finally, the population reaches an asymptote when the population density reaches the carrying capacity.<br><br>16. A plot of N (population density) in relation to time (t) results in a sigmoid curve for logistic growth.<br><br>17. This type of population growth is called Verhulst-Pearl Logistic Growth as shown in Figure 11.3.<br><br>18. Logistic growth is described by the equation: dN/dt = rN[(K - N)/K].<br><br>19. In the logistic growth equation, K represents the carrying capacity.<br><br>20. In the logistic growth equation, N represents the population density.<br><br>21. In the logistic growth equation, r represents the intrinsic rate of natural increase.<br><br>22. The term [(K - N)/K] in the logistic equation represents the effect of resource limitation on growth.<br><br>23. When N approaches K in logistic growth, the population growth rate approaches zero at the asymptote phase.<br><br>24. Logistic growth differs from exponential growth because it considers limited resources and carrying capacity."],

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Parasitism has evolved in so many taxonomic groups from plants to higher vertebrates.<br><br>2. Many parasites have evolved to be host-specific, meaning they can parasitise only a single species of host.<br><br>3. Both host and the parasite tend to co-evolve; that is, if the host evolves special mechanisms for rejecting or resisting the parasite, the parasite has to evolve mechanisms to counteract and neutralise them.<br><br>4. In order to be successful with the same host species, parasites evolved special adaptations.<br><br>5. Special adaptations of parasites include the loss of unnecessary sense organs, presence of adhesive organs or suckers to cling on to the host, loss of digestive system and high reproductive capacity.<br><br>6. The life cycles of parasites are often complex, involving one or two intermediate hosts or vectors to facilitate parasitisation of its primary host.<br><br>7. The human liver fluke (a trematode parasite) depends on two intermediate hosts (a snail and a fish) to complete its life cycle.<br><br>8. The malarial parasite needs a vector (mosquito) to spread to other hosts.<br><br>9. Majority of the parasites harm the host; they may reduce the survival, growth and reproduction of the host and reduce its population density.<br><br>10. Parasites might render the host more vulnerable to predation by making it physically weak.<br><br>11. An ideal parasite should be able to thrive within the host without harming it, but natural selection did not lead to the evolution of such totally harmless parasites.<br><br>12. Parasites that feed on the external surface of the host organism are called ectoparasites.<br><br>13. The most familiar examples of ectoparasites are the lice on humans and ticks on dogs.<br><br>14. Many marine fish are infested with ectoparasitic copepods.<br><br>15. Cuscuta is a parasitic plant that is commonly found growing on hedge plants.<br><br>16. Cuscuta has lost its chlorophyll and leaves in the course of evolution.<br><br>17. Cuscuta derives its nutrition from the host plant which it parasitises.<br><br>18. The female mosquito is not considered a parasite, although it needs our blood for reproduction (not for nutrition).<br><br>19. Endoparasites are those that live inside the host body at different sites (liver, kidney, lungs, red blood cells, etc.).<br><br>20. The life cycles of endoparasites are more complex because of their extreme specialisation.<br><br>21. The morphological and anatomical features of endoparasites are greatly simplified while emphasising their reproductive potential.<br><br>22. Brood parasitism in birds is a fascinating example of parasitism in which the parasitic bird lays its eggs in the nest of its host and lets the host incubate them.<br><br>23. During the course of evolution, the eggs of the parasitic bird have evolved to resemble the host's egg in size and colour to reduce the chances of the host detecting them."],

The male bee is attracted to what it perceives as a female, pseudocopulates with the flower, and during that process is dusted with pollen from the flower.<br><br>17. When this same bee pseudocopulates with another flower, it transfers pollen to it and thus, pollinates the flower.<br><br>18. Co-evolution operates such that if the bee's colour patterns change even slightly (for any reason) during evolution, pollination success will be reduced unless the flower co-evolves to maintain the resemblance of its petal to the female bee.<br><br>19.

India is one of the 12 mega diversity countries of the world.<br><br>3. Nearly 45,000 species of plants have been recorded from India.<br><br>4. Twice as many animal species as plant species have been recorded from India, meaning approximately 90,000 animal species.<br><br>5. According to May's global estimates, only 22 per cent of the total species have been recorded so far.<br><br>6. Applying May's proportion to India's diversity, there are probably more than 1,00,000 plant species yet to be discovered and described.<br><br>7. More than 3,00,000 animal species are estimated to be yet undiscovered and described in India.<br><br>8. The immense trained manpower in the form of taxonomists and the time required make it difficult to compile the complete inventory of biological wealth.<br><br>9. A large fraction of species faces the threat of becoming extinct even before we discover them.<br><br>10. The loss of undiscovered species is metaphorically described as Nature's giant library burning even before we catalogued the titles of all the books stocked there.<br><br>11. The diversity of plants and animals is not uniform throughout the world but shows a rather uneven distribution.<br><br>12. The most well-known pattern in biodiversity is the latitudinal gradient in diversity.<br><br>13. Species diversity decreases as we move away from the equator towards the poles in general.<br><br>14. With very few exceptions, tropics with latitudinal range of 23.5 degree N to 23.5 degree S harbour more species than temperate or polar regions.<br><br>15. Colombia located near the equator has nearly 1,400 species of birds.<br><br>16. New York at 41 degree N has 105 species of birds.<br><br>17. Greenland at 71 degree N has only 56 species of birds.<br><br>18. India with much of its land area in tropical latitudes has more than 1,200 species of birds.<br><br>19. A forest in a tropical region like Equador has up to 10 times as many species of vascular plants as a forest of equal area in a temperate region like the Midwest of the USA.<br><br>20. The largely tropical Amazonian rain forest in South America has the greatest biodiversity on earth.<br><br>21. The Amazonian rain forest is home to more than 40,000 species of plants.<br><br>22. The Amazonian rain forest contains 3,000 species of fishes.<br><br>23. The Amazonian rain forest has 1,300 species of birds.<br><br>24.

A stable community must be either resistant or resilient to occasional disturbances, both natural and man-made.<br><br>3. A stable community must be resistant to invasions by alien species.<br><br>4. The attributes of stable communities are linked to species richness in a community, though the mechanism is not completely understood.<br><br>5. David Tilman conducted long-term ecosystem experiments using outdoor plots to study biodiversity effects.<br><br>6. Tilman found that plots with more species showed less year-to-year variation in total biomass.<br><br>7. In Tilman's experiments, increased diversity contributed to higher productivity.<br><br>8. Rich biodiversity is not only essential for ecosystem health but imperative for the very survival of the human race on this planet.<br><br>9. We are currently losing species at an alarming pace.<br><br>10. The rivet popper hypothesis is an analogy used by Stanford ecologist Paul Ehrlich to explain the importance of biodiversity.<br><br>11. In the rivet popper hypothesis, an airplane represents an ecosystem.<br><br>12. In the rivet popper hypothesis, rivets represent species in the ecosystem.<br><br>13. In the rivet popper hypothesis, passengers represent organisms that cause species extinctions.<br><br>14. According to the rivet popper hypothesis, popping a rivet causing species extinction may not affect flight safety or proper ecosystem functioning initially.<br><br>15. As more and more rivets are removed, the plane becomes dangerously weak over a period of time.<br><br>16. Which rivet is removed may also be critical in the rivet popper hypothesis.<br><br>17. Loss of rivets on the wings represents loss of key species that drive major ecosystem functions.<br><br>18. Loss of rivets on wings is a more serious threat to flight safety than loss of rivets on seats or windows inside the plane.<br><br>19. It is doubtful if any new species are being added through speciation into the earth's treasury of species.<br><br>20. There is no doubt about the continuing losses of species.<br><br>21. The biological wealth of our planet has been declining rapidly.<br><br>22. The accusing finger for biodiversity loss is clearly pointing to human activities.<br><br>23. The colonisation of tropical Pacific islands is said to have led to the extinction of more than 2,000 species of native birds.<br><br>24. The IUCN Red List 2004 documents the extinction of 784 species in total.<br><br>25. The 784 extinct species include 338 vertebrates, 359 invertebrates and 87 plants.<br><br>26. These extinctions documented in IUCN Red List 2004 occurred in the last five hundred years.<br><br>27. Examples of recent extinctions include the dodo from Mauritius.<br><br>28. The quagga from Africa is an example of recent extinction.<br><br>29. The thylacine from Australia is an example of recent extinction.<br><br>30. Steller's Sea Cow from Russia is an example of recent extinction.<br><br>31. Three subspecies of tiger - Bali, Javan, and Caspian - have gone extinct.<br><br>32.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Overexploitation is the third major cause in the Evil Quartet leading to biodiversity loss.<br><br>2. Many species extinctions in the last 500 years such as Stellers sea cow and passenger pigeon were due to overexploitation by humans.<br><br>3. Presently many marine fish populations around the world are over harvested endangering the continued existence of some commercially important species.<br><br>4. Alien species invasions is the third cause in the Evil Quartet when alien species are introduced unintentionally or deliberately.<br><br>5. Some alien species turn invasive and cause decline or extinction of indigenous species.<br><br>6. The Nile perch introduced into Lake Victoria in east Africa led eventually to the extinction of an ecologically unique assemblage of more than 200 species of cichlid fish.<br><br>7. Invasive weed species like carrot grass or Parthenium cause environmental damage and threat to native species.<br><br>8. Lantana is an invasive weed species that poses threat to native species.<br><br>9. Water hyacinth or Eichhornia is an invasive weed species causing environmental damage.<br><br>10. The recent illegal introduction of the African catfish Clarias gariepinus for aquaculture purposes is posing a threat to the indigenous catfishes in our rivers.<br><br>11. Co-extinctions is the fourth major cause in the Evil Quartet.<br><br>12. In co-extinctions when a species becomes extinct the plant and animal species associated with it in an obligatory way also become extinct.<br><br>13. When a host fish species becomes extinct its unique assemblage of parasites also meets the same fate.<br><br>14. In a coevolved plant-pollinator mutualism extinction of one invariably leads to the extinction of the other.<br><br>15. There are many reasons for conserving biodiversity that can be grouped into three categories: narrowly utilitarian, broadly utilitarian, and ethical.<br><br>16. The narrowly utilitarian arguments for conserving biodiversity focus on countless direct economic benefits humans derive from nature.<br><br>17. Direct economic benefits include food such as cereals, pulses and fruits.<br><br>18. Firewood, fibre and construction material are examples of direct economic benefits from nature.<br><br>19. Industrial products like tannins, lubricants, dyes, resins and perfumes are derived from nature.<br><br>20. Products of medicinal importance are among the direct economic benefits from biodiversity.<br><br>21. More than 25 per cent of the drugs currently sold in the market worldwide are derived from plants.<br><br>22. 25,000 species of plants contribute to the traditional medicines used by native peoples around the world.<br><br>23. Many more medicinally useful plants are waiting to be explored in tropical rain forests.<br><br>24. Bioprospecting involves exploring molecular, genetic and species-level diversity for products of economic importance.<br><br>25. Nations endowed with rich biodiversity can expect to reap enormous benefits through bioprospecting.<br><br>26.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. The number of species harboured by biodiversity hotspots is extremely high.<br><br>2. Strict protection of these hotspots could reduce the ongoing mass extinctions by almost 30 per cent.<br><br>3. In India ecologically unique and biodiversity rich regions are legally protected as biosphere reserves, national parks and sanctuaries.<br><br>4. India now has 14 biosphere reserves, 90 national parks and 448 wildlife sanctuaries.<br><br>5. India has a history of religious and cultural traditions that emphasised protection of nature.<br><br>6. In many cultures tracts of forest were set aside and all the trees and wildlife within were venerated and given total protection.<br><br>7. Such sacred groves are found in Khasi and Jaintia Hills in Meghalaya.<br><br>8. Sacred groves are found in Aravalli Hills of Rajasthan.<br><br>9. Sacred groves are found in Western Ghat regions of Karnataka and Maharashtra.<br><br>10. Sacred groves are found in the Sarguja, Chanda and Bastar areas of Madhya Pradesh.<br><br>11. In Meghalaya the sacred groves are the last refuges for a large number of rare and threatened plants.<br><br>12. In ex situ conservation threatened animals and plants are taken out from their natural habitat and placed in special setting where they can be protected and given special care.<br><br>13. Zoological parks, botanical gardens and wildlife safari parks serve the purpose of ex situ conservation.<br><br>14. There are many animals that have become extinct in the wild but continue to be maintained in zoological parks.<br><br>15. In recent years ex situ conservation has advanced beyond keeping threatened species in enclosures.<br><br>16. Gametes of threatened species can be preserved in viable and fertile condition for long periods using cryopreservation techniques.<br><br>17. Eggs can be fertilised in vitro in advanced ex situ conservation.<br><br>18. Plants can be propagated using tissue culture methods in ex situ conservation.<br><br>19. Seeds of different genetic strains of commercially important plants can be kept for long periods in seed banks.<br><br>20. Biodiversity knows no political boundaries and its conservation is therefore a collective responsibility of all nations.<br><br>21. The historic Convention on Biological Diversity is also known as The Earth Summit.<br><br>22. The Earth Summit was held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.<br><br>23. The Earth Summit called upon all nations to take appropriate measures for conservation of biodiversity and sustainable utilisation of its benefits.<br><br>24. The World Summit on Sustainable Development was held in 2002 in Johannesburg South Africa as a follow-up to the Earth Summit.<br><br>25. 190 countries pledged their commitment at the World Summit on Sustainable Development.<br><br>26. The commitment was to achieve by 2010 a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss at global, regional and local levels."],
