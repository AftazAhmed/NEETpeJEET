Early Greeks like Hippocrates and Indian Ayurveda system asserted that health was a balance of certain humors in body and mind.<br><br>3. William Harvey discovered blood circulation using experimental methods which disproved the good humor hypothesis.<br><br>4. Demonstration of normal body temperature in persons with blackbile using a thermometer also disproved the good humor hypothesis of health.<br><br>5. Health is now defined as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being.<br><br>6. When people are in good health, they are more efficient at work which increases productivity and brings economic prosperity.<br><br>7. Good health increases longevity of people and reduces infant and maternal mortality.<br><br>8. A person is considered healthy when able to maintain equilibrium between all three factors: physical, mental and social well-being.<br><br>9. The state of complete health is disturbed in two ways: disease and infirmity or disability.<br><br>10. Infirmity refers to abnormality in the structure or function of body parts.<br><br>11. Disease is a disorder in any of the body systems or organs which is characterized by a set of characteristic symptoms.<br><br>12. In general, diseases have definite etiology, pathology and symptomatology.<br><br>13. Some diseases are acute while others are chronic based on their duration.<br><br>14. Diseases may be communicable or non-communicable.<br><br>15. Diseases may be infectious or non-infectious.<br><br>16. The term health is frequently used nowadays as common people are becoming health conscious.<br><br>17. Disease and infirmity are two different ways in which complete health state is disturbed."],

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Tissue matching and blood group matching are essential before undertaking any graft or transplant to prevent rejection.<br><br>2. Transplant patients must take immunosuppressants throughout their life to prevent graft rejection.<br><br>3. The body is able to differentiate self from nonself tissues.<br><br>4. Cell-mediated immune response is responsible for graft rejection in transplant patients.<br><br>5. Active immunity develops when antibodies are produced in host body after exposure to antigens in form of living or dead microbes or proteins.<br><br>6. Active immunity is slow and takes time to give its full effective response.<br><br>7. Injecting microbes deliberately during immunisation or natural infection by organisms induce active immunity.<br><br>8. Passive immunity is provided when ready-made antibodies are directly given to protect body against foreign agents.<br><br>9. Colostrum is the yellowish fluid secreted by mother during initial days of lactation.<br><br>10. Colostrum has abundant IgA antibodies to protect the newborn infant.<br><br>11. The foetus receives some antibodies from mother through placenta during pregnancy as passive immunity.<br><br>12. The principle of immunisation or vaccination is based on the property of memory of the immune system.<br><br>13. In vaccination, antigenic proteins of pathogen or inactivated or weakened pathogen are introduced into body.<br><br>14. Antibodies produced during vaccination neutralise pathogenic agents during actual infection.<br><br>15. Vaccines generate memory B and T-cells that recognise pathogen quickly on subsequent exposure.<br><br>16. Memory cells overwhelm invaders with massive production of antibodies on re-exposure.<br><br>17. When quick immune response is required as in tetanus, preformed antibodies or antitoxin must be directly injected.<br><br>18. Antitoxin is a preparation containing antibodies to the toxin.<br><br>19. In snakebite cases, injection given to patients contain preformed antibodies against snake venom.<br><br>20. Immunisation using preformed antibodies is called passive immunisation.<br><br>21. Recombinant DNA technology has allowed production of antigenic polypeptides of pathogen in bacteria or yeast.<br><br>22. Recombinant DNA vaccines allow large scale production and greater availability for immunisation.<br><br>23. Hepatitis B vaccine is produced from yeast using recombinant DNA technology."],

Cell growth and differentiation in the body is highly controlled and regulated.<br><br>3. In cancer cells, there is breakdown of regulatory mechanisms that control cell growth.<br><br>4. Normal cells show a property called contact inhibition by virtue of which contact with other cells inhibits their uncontrolled growth.<br><br>5. Cancer cells have lost the property of contact inhibition, allowing them to continue dividing uncontrollably.<br><br>6. Uncontrolled division of cancerous cells gives rise to masses of cells called tumors.<br><br>7. Tumors are of two types: benign tumors and malignant tumors.<br><br>8. Benign tumors normally remain confined to their original location and do not spread to other parts of the body, causing little damage.<br><br>9. Malignant tumors are a mass of proliferating cells called neoplastic or tumor cells.<br><br>10. Malignant tumor cells grow very rapidly, invading and damaging the surrounding normal tissues.<br><br>11. Malignant tumor cells actively divide and grow, starving normal cells by competing for vital nutrients.<br><br>12. Cells sloughed from tumors reach distant sites through blood and start new tumors wherever they get lodged in the body.<br><br>13. Metastasis is the property where tumor cells spread to distant sites and is the most feared property of malignant tumors.<br><br>14. Transformation of normal cells into cancerous neoplastic cells may be induced by physical, chemical or biological agents.<br><br>15. Agents that cause cancer are called carcinogens.<br><br>16. Ionising radiations like X-rays and gamma rays cause DNA damage leading to neoplastic transformation.<br><br>17. Non-ionizing radiations like UV also cause DNA damage leading to cancer.<br><br>18. Chemical carcinogens present in tobacco smoke have been identified as a major cause of lung cancer.<br><br>19. Cancer causing viruses are called oncogenic viruses.<br><br>20. Oncogenic viruses have genes called viral oncogenes.<br><br>21. Several genes called cellular oncogenes (c-onc) or proto oncogenes have been identified in normal cells.<br><br>22. Proto oncogenes when activated under certain conditions could lead to oncogenic transformation of cells.<br><br>23. Early detection of cancers is essential as it allows the disease to be treated successfully in many cases.<br><br>24. Cancer detection is based on biopsy and histopathological studies of the tissue.<br><br>25.

In biopsy, a piece of the suspected tissue is cut into thin sections, stained and examined under microscope by a pathologist for histopathological studies.<br><br>27. Techniques like radiography using X-rays, CT (computed tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) are very useful to detect cancers of internal organs.<br><br>28. Computed tomography uses X-rays to generate a three-dimensional image of the internals of an object.<br><br>29.

Sewage treatment is carried out in two stages: primary and secondary treatment.<br><br>3. Primary treatment involves physical removal of particles through filtration and sedimentation.<br><br>4. Initially, floating debris is removed by sequential filtration in primary treatment.<br><br>5. Grit consisting of soil and small pebbles is removed by sedimentation.<br><br>6. All solids that settle during primary treatment form the primary sludge.<br><br>7. The supernatant liquid above settled solids forms the effluent in primary treatment.<br><br>8. The effluent from primary settling tank is taken for secondary treatment.<br><br>9. Secondary treatment is also called biological treatment.<br><br>10. Primary effluent is passed into large aeration tanks where it is constantly agitated mechanically.<br><br>11. Air is pumped into aeration tanks to allow vigorous growth of aerobic microbes.<br><br>12. Aerobic microbes grow into flocs which are masses of bacteria associated with fungal filaments forming mesh-like structures.<br><br>13. While growing, flocs consume the major part of organic matter in the effluent.<br><br>14. Consumption of organic matter by flocs significantly reduces the BOD of effluent.<br><br>15. BOD stands for Biochemical Oxygen Demand.<br><br>16. BOD refers to the amount of oxygen that would be consumed if all organic matter in one liter of water were oxidized by bacteria.<br><br>17. Sewage water is treated till the BOD is reduced significantly.<br><br>18. The BOD test measures the rate of uptake of oxygen by microorganisms in a water sample.<br><br>19. BOD is indirectly a measure of the organic matter present in water.<br><br>20. The greater the BOD of waste water, more is its polluting potential.<br><br>21. After BOD reduction, effluent is passed into settling tank where bacterial flocs sediment.<br><br>22. The sediment formed after secondary treatment is called activated sludge.<br><br>23. A small part of activated sludge is pumped back into aeration tank to serve as inoculum.<br><br>24. The major part of activated sludge is pumped into large tanks called anaerobic sludge digesters.<br><br>25. In anaerobic sludge digesters, bacteria that grow anaerobically digest the bacteria and fungi in the sludge.<br><br>26. During anaerobic digestion, bacteria produce a mixture of gases: methane, hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide.<br><br>27. The gases produced in anaerobic digesters form biogas which can be used as source of energy as it is inflammable.<br><br>28. The effluent from secondary treatment plant is generally released into natural water bodies like rivers and streams.<br><br>29. Figure 8.7 shows an aerial view of a sewage treatment plant.<br><br>30.

The organic farmer is aware that eradication of pests is not only possible but also undesirable.<br><br>3. Beneficial predator and parasitic insects depend on pests as food or hosts for survival.<br><br>4. Use of harmful chemicals to control pests and weeds creates dependence on toxic chemicals and pesticides.<br><br>5. Biological farming approach conserves familiar wildlife such as hedgerow birds while maintaining productivity.<br><br>6. IPM aims to keep pest population below an economic injury level.<br><br>7. IPM uses judicious knowledge of beneficial insects, their life cycles, feeding patterns and habitat to develop biocontrol means.<br><br>8. Ladybird beetles with red and black markings are useful to get rid of aphids.<br><br>9. Dragonflies are useful biocontrol agents to get rid of mosquitoes.<br><br>10. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a bacteria used to control butterfly caterpillars.<br><br>11. Bacillus thuringiensis is available in sachets as dried spores mixed with water and sprayed onto vulnerable brassicas and fruit trees.<br><br>12. In the gut of insect larvae, Bt toxin is released and kills the larvae.<br><br>13. The bacterial disease from Bt kills caterpillars but leaves other insects unharmed.<br><br>14. Through genetic engineering, B. thuringiensis toxin genes have been introduced into plants making them pest resistant.<br><br>15. Bt cotton is an example of plants with Bt toxin genes and is cultivated in some states of India.<br><br>16. Trichoderma is a fungus used as biocontrol agent for treatment of plant diseases.<br><br>17. Trichoderma species are free-living fungi very common in root ecosystems.<br><br>18. Trichoderma are effective biocontrol agents of several plant pathogens.<br><br>19. Baculoviruses are pathogens that attack insects and other arthropods.<br><br>20. Majority of baculoviruses used as biological control agents belong to genus Nucleopolyhedrovirus.<br><br>21.

Bioprocess engineering involves maintenance of sterile or microbial contamination-free ambience in chemical engineering processes.<br><br>3. The purpose of bioprocess engineering is to enable growth of only desired microbe or eukaryotic cell in large quantities.<br><br>4. Biotechnological products manufactured through bioprocess engineering include antibiotics, vaccines, and enzymes.<br><br>5. Sexual reproduction provides advantages over asexual reproduction by providing opportunities for variations.<br><br>6. Sexual reproduction permits formulation of unique combinations of genetic setup which may be beneficial to organism and population.<br><br>7. Asexual reproduction preserves the genetic information while sexual reproduction permits variation.<br><br>8. Traditional hybridisation procedures in plant and animal breeding often lead to inclusion of undesirable genes along with desired genes.<br><br>9. Traditional hybridisation also leads to multiplication of undesirable genes in offspring.<br><br>10. Genetic engineering techniques include creation of recombinant DNA, use of gene cloning, and gene transfer.<br><br>11. Genetic engineering overcomes limitations of traditional breeding by allowing isolation of only desirable genes.<br><br>12. Genetic engineering allows introduction of desirable genes without introducing undesirable genes into target organism.<br><br>13. An alien piece of DNA transferred into an organism would most likely not multiply itself in the progeny cells.<br><br>14. When alien DNA gets integrated into genome of recipient, it may multiply and be inherited along with host DNA.<br><br>15. In a chromosome there is a specific DNA sequence called origin of replication which initiates replication.<br><br>16. For multiplication of any alien DNA in an organism, it needs to be part of a chromosome having origin of replication.<br><br>17. An alien DNA is linked with origin of replication so that it can replicate and multiply in host organism.<br><br>18. The process of making multiple identical copies of template DNA is called cloning.<br><br>19. Plasmid is the key tool for construction of the first recombinant DNA molecule.<br><br>20. A plasmid is an autonomously replicating circular extra chromosomal DNA.<br><br>21. The first recombinant DNA was constructed by linking a gene encoding antibiotic resistance with native plasmid of Salmonella typhimurium.<br><br>22. Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer accomplished construction of first recombinant DNA in 1972.<br><br>23. The antibiotic resistance gene was isolated by cutting out a piece of DNA from plasmid responsible for conferring antibiotic resistance.<br><br>24.

Bacillus thuringiensis forms protein crystals during a particular phase of their growth which contain a toxic insecticidal protein.<br><br>15. Bt toxin protein exists as inactive protoxins in Bacillus bacterium, which is why the toxin does not kill the bacterium itself.<br><br>16. When an insect ingests the inactive Bt toxin, it is converted into active form due to the alkaline pH of the gut which solubilises the crystals.<br><br>17. The activated Bt toxin binds to the surface of midgut epithelial cells and creates pores that cause cell swelling and lysis and eventually death of the insect.<br><br>18.

Sea anemone with stinging tentacles and clown fish living among them is another example of commensalism.<br><br>10. Clown fish gets protection from predators which stay away from stinging tentacles of sea anemone.<br><br>11. The sea anemone does not appear to derive any benefit by hosting the clown fish in commensalism.<br><br>12. Mutualism is interaction that confers benefits on both the interacting species.<br><br>13. Lichens represent an intimate mutualistic relationship between a fungus and photosynthesising algae or cyanobacteria.<br><br>14. Mycorrhizae are associations between fungi and the roots of higher plants as example of mutualism.<br><br>15. In mycorrhizae, fungi help the plant in absorption of essential nutrients from the soil.<br><br>16. In mycorrhizae, the plant in turn provides the fungi with energy-yielding carbohydrates from photosynthesis.<br><br>17. Figure 11.4 shows mutual relationship between fig tree and wasp where fig flower is pollinated by wasp.<br><br>18. In fig-wasp mutualism, wasp lays eggs in fig fruit while providing pollination service to fig tree.<br><br>19. An epiphyte is a plant like orchid that grows on another plant without parasitizing or harming it.<br><br>20. In commensalism, the commensal species benefits while the host species is neither benefited nor harmed.<br><br>21. Cattle egrets benefit by catching insects stirred up by grazing cattle movement through vegetation.<br><br>22. Cattle are neither harmed nor benefited by the presence of foraging egrets in commensalism.<br><br>23. Clown fish and sea anemone show commensalism not mutualism as anemone derives no apparent benefit.<br><br>24. Mutualistic relationships like lichens, mycorrhizae and fig-wasp show both species benefiting from the interaction.<br><br>25. Orchid as epiphyte on mango tree is commensalism not mutualism as mango tree is unaffected by orchid presence."],

The decomposers in a pond are fungi, bacteria and flagellates, especially abundant at the bottom.<br><br>12. The ecosystem performs conversion of inorganic into organic material with the help of radiant energy of the sun by the autotrophs.<br><br>13. Consumption of autotrophs is done by heterotrophs in the ecosystem.<br><br>14. Decomposition and mineralisation of dead matter releases them back for reuse by the autotrophs.<br><br>15. There is unidirectional movement of energy towards the higher trophic levels and its dissipation and loss as heat to the environment.<br><br>16. A constant input of solar energy is the basic requirement for any ecosystem to function and sustain.<br><br>17. Primary productivity is defined as the amount of organic matter produced in an ecosystem.<br><br>18.

No energy that is trapped into an organism remains in it forever.<br><br>15. The energy trapped by the producer is either passed on to a consumer or the organism dies.<br><br>16. Death of organism is the beginning of the detritus food chain or web.<br><br>17. Animals that depend on plants for food are called consumers and also heterotrophs.<br><br>18. Animals that feed on producers are called primary consumers.<br><br>19. Animals that eat other animals which in turn eat plants are called secondary consumers.<br><br>20. Primary consumers are herbivores.<br><br>21. Some common herbivores in terrestrial ecosystem are insects, birds and mammals.<br><br>22. Molluscs are common herbivores in aquatic ecosystem.<br><br>23. The consumers that feed on herbivores are carnivores, or more correctly primary carnivores though secondary consumers.<br><br>24. Animals that depend on the primary carnivores for food are labelled secondary carnivores.<br><br>25. A grazing food chain example is: Grass (Producer) to Goat (Primary Consumer) to Man (Secondary consumer)."],

The base of each pyramid represents the producers or the first trophic level.<br><br>3. The apex of the pyramid represents tertiary or top level consumer.<br><br>4. The three types of ecological pyramids that are usually studied are pyramid of number, pyramid of biomass and pyramid of energy.<br><br>5. Figure 12.4 (a) shows pyramid of numbers in a grassland ecosystem.<br><br>6. In a grassland ecosystem, only three top-carnivores are supported based on production of nearly 6 millions plants.<br><br>7. In the pyramid of numbers in grassland ecosystem, producers number 5,842,000, primary consumers 708,000, secondary consumers 3,54,000 and tertiary consumers 3.<br><br>8. Figure 12.4 (b) shows pyramid of biomass which demonstrates a sharp decrease in biomass at higher trophic levels.<br><br>9. In the pyramid of biomass, the dry weight of producers is 809 kg m-2, primary consumers 37 kg m-2, secondary consumers 11 kg m-2 and tertiary consumers 1.5 kg m-2.<br><br>10. Figure 12.4 (c) shows an inverted pyramid of biomass.<br><br>11. In an inverted pyramid of biomass, a small standing crop of phytoplankton supports large standing crop of zooplankton.<br><br>12. In the inverted pyramid, phytoplankton (producers) have dry weight of 4 kg m-2 while primary consumers have 21 kg m-2.<br><br>13. The inverted pyramid of biomass is characteristic of aquatic ecosystems with phytoplankton as producers.<br><br>14. The pyramid of energy can never be inverted in a natural ecosystem.<br><br>15. The pyramid of numbers in a grassland ecosystem is always upright.<br><br>16. The pyramid of biomass in pond or aquatic ecosystems is generally inverted.<br><br>17.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. India has only 2.4 per cent of the world's land area but its share of global species diversity is an impressive 8.1 per cent.<br><br>2. India is one of the 12 mega diversity countries of the world.<br><br>3. Nearly 45,000 species of plants have been recorded from India.<br><br>4. Twice as many animals as plants have been recorded from India meaning approximately 90,000 animal species.<br><br>5. According to May's global estimates, only 22 per cent of total species have been recorded so far.<br><br>6. Applying May's proportion to India, more than 1,00,000 plant species are yet to be discovered and described.<br><br>7. More than 3,00,000 animal species in India are yet to be discovered and described.<br><br>8. A large fraction of species faces the threat of becoming extinct even before we discover them.<br><br>9. The metaphor Nature's biological library is burning refers to species extinction before cataloguing.<br><br>10. Latitudinal gradient in diversity is the most well-known pattern of biodiversity.<br><br>11. The diversity of plants and animals is not uniform throughout the world but shows uneven distribution.<br><br>12. Species diversity decreases as we move away from the equator towards the poles.<br><br>13. With very few exceptions, tropics harbour more species than temperate or polar areas.<br><br>14. Tropics have a latitudinal range of 23.5 degree N to 23.5 degree S.<br><br>15. Colombia located near the equator has nearly 1,400 species of birds.<br><br>16. New York at 41 degree N has 105 species of birds.<br><br>17. Greenland at 71 degree N has only 56 species of birds.<br><br>18. India with much of its land area in tropical latitudes has more than 1,200 species of birds.<br><br>19. A tropical forest in Ecuador has up to 10 times as many vascular plant species as a temperate forest of equal area.<br><br>20. The Amazonian rain forest in South America has the greatest biodiversity on earth.<br><br>21. The Amazonian rain forest is home to more than 40,000 species of plants.<br><br>22. The Amazon has 3,000 species of fishes, 1,300 species of birds, 427 mammals, 427 amphibians, and 378 reptiles.<br><br>23. More than 1,25,000 invertebrate species are found in the Amazonian rain forest.<br><br>24. Scientists estimate at least two million insect species are waiting to be discovered in Amazonian rain forests.<br><br>25. Speciation is generally a function of time according to ecologists and evolutionary biologists.<br><br>26.

answer: "c) Producing 20 per cent oxygen through photosynthesis"
}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. The Amazon forest is estimated to produce 20 per cent of total oxygen in earth's atmosphere through photosynthesis.<br><br>2. Pollination is an ecosystem service provided through pollinators like bees, bumblebees, birds and bats.<br><br>3. Without pollination, plants cannot give us fruits or seeds.<br><br>4. Intangible benefits from nature include aesthetic pleasures of walking through thick woods, watching spring flowers in full bloom or waking up to a bulbul's song.<br><br>5. The ethical argument for conserving biodiversity relates to what we owe to millions of plant, animal and microbe species sharing this planet.<br><br>6. Philosophically or spiritually, every species has an intrinsic value even without current or any economic value to us.<br><br>7. We have a moral duty to care for the well-being of all species.<br><br>8. We must pass on our biological legacy in good order to future generations.<br><br>9. In situ conservation means on site conservation where we protect the whole ecosystem.<br><br>10. In situ conservation example is saving the entire forest to save the tiger.<br><br>11. Ex situ conservation means off site conservation outside natural habitats.<br><br>12. Ex situ conservation is desirable when animal or plant is endangered or threatened needing urgent measures.<br><br>13. Endangered or threatened organisms face very high risk of extinction in wild in near future.<br><br>14. Many nations face conflict between development and conservation priorities.<br><br>15. Number of species waiting to be saved exceeds conservation resources available.<br><br>16. Biodiversity hotspots are regions with very high levels of species richness and high degree of endemism.<br><br>17. Endemism means species confined to that region and not found anywhere else.<br><br>18. Initially 25 biodiversity hotspots were identified.<br><br>19. Subsequently nine more biodiversity hotspots were added to the list.<br><br>20. Total number of biodiversity hotspots in the world is 34.<br><br>21. Biodiversity hotspots are also regions of accelerated habitat loss.<br><br>22. Three hotspots cover India: Western Ghats and Sri Lanka, Indo-Burma and Himalaya.<br><br>23. All biodiversity hotspots put together cover less than 2 per cent of earth's land area.<br><br>24. Broadly utilitarian arguments include ecosystem services like oxygen production and pollination.<br><br>25. Conservationists identified biodiversity hotspots for maximum protection."],
