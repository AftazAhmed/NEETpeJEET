Humus is highly resistant to microbial action and undergoes decomposition at an extremely slow rate.<br><br>3. Being colloidal in nature, humus serves as a reservoir of nutrients.<br><br>4. The humus is further degraded by some microbes and release of inorganic nutrients occur by the process known as mineralisation.<br><br>5. Decomposition is largely an oxygen requiring process.<br><br>6. The rate of decomposition is controlled by chemical composition of detritus and climatic factors.<br><br>7. In a particular climatic condition, decomposition rate is slower if detritus is rich in lignin and chitin.<br><br>8. Decomposition rate is quicker if detritus is rich in nitrogen and water soluble substances like sugars.<br><br>9.

India is one of the 12 mega diversity countries of the world.<br><br>3. Nearly 45,000 species of plants have been recorded from India.<br><br>4. Twice as many animal species as plant species have been recorded from India, meaning approximately 90,000 animal species.<br><br>5. According to May's global estimates, only 22 per cent of the total species have been recorded so far.<br><br>6. Applying May's proportion to India's diversity, there are probably more than 1,00,000 plant species yet to be discovered and described.<br><br>7. More than 3,00,000 animal species are estimated to be yet undiscovered and described in India.<br><br>8. The immense trained manpower in the form of taxonomists and the time required make it difficult to compile the complete inventory of biological wealth.<br><br>9. A large fraction of species faces the threat of becoming extinct even before we discover them.<br><br>10. The loss of undiscovered species is metaphorically described as Nature's giant library burning even before we catalogued the titles of all the books stocked there.<br><br>11. The diversity of plants and animals is not uniform throughout the world but shows a rather uneven distribution.<br><br>12. The most well-known pattern in biodiversity is the latitudinal gradient in diversity.<br><br>13. Species diversity decreases as we move away from the equator towards the poles in general.<br><br>14. With very few exceptions, tropics with latitudinal range of 23.5 degree N to 23.5 degree S harbour more species than temperate or polar regions.<br><br>15. Colombia located near the equator has nearly 1,400 species of birds.<br><br>16. New York at 41 degree N has 105 species of birds.<br><br>17. Greenland at 71 degree N has only 56 species of birds.<br><br>18. India with much of its land area in tropical latitudes has more than 1,200 species of birds.<br><br>19. A forest in a tropical region like Equador has up to 10 times as many species of vascular plants as a forest of equal area in a temperate region like the Midwest of the USA.<br><br>20. The largely tropical Amazonian rain forest in South America has the greatest biodiversity on earth.<br><br>21. The Amazonian rain forest is home to more than 40,000 species of plants.<br><br>22. The Amazonian rain forest contains 3,000 species of fishes.<br><br>23. The Amazonian rain forest has 1,300 species of birds.<br><br>24.

A stable community must be either resistant or resilient to occasional disturbances, both natural and man-made.<br><br>3. A stable community must be resistant to invasions by alien species.<br><br>4. The attributes of stable communities are linked to species richness in a community, though the mechanism is not completely understood.<br><br>5. David Tilman conducted long-term ecosystem experiments using outdoor plots to study biodiversity effects.<br><br>6. Tilman found that plots with more species showed less year-to-year variation in total biomass.<br><br>7. In Tilman's experiments, increased diversity contributed to higher productivity.<br><br>8. Rich biodiversity is not only essential for ecosystem health but imperative for the very survival of the human race on this planet.<br><br>9. We are currently losing species at an alarming pace.<br><br>10. The rivet popper hypothesis is an analogy used by Stanford ecologist Paul Ehrlich to explain the importance of biodiversity.<br><br>11. In the rivet popper hypothesis, an airplane represents an ecosystem.<br><br>12. In the rivet popper hypothesis, rivets represent species in the ecosystem.<br><br>13. In the rivet popper hypothesis, passengers represent organisms that cause species extinctions.<br><br>14. According to the rivet popper hypothesis, popping a rivet causing species extinction may not affect flight safety or proper ecosystem functioning initially.<br><br>15. As more and more rivets are removed, the plane becomes dangerously weak over a period of time.<br><br>16. Which rivet is removed may also be critical in the rivet popper hypothesis.<br><br>17. Loss of rivets on the wings represents loss of key species that drive major ecosystem functions.<br><br>18. Loss of rivets on wings is a more serious threat to flight safety than loss of rivets on seats or windows inside the plane.<br><br>19. It is doubtful if any new species are being added through speciation into the earth's treasury of species.<br><br>20. There is no doubt about the continuing losses of species.<br><br>21. The biological wealth of our planet has been declining rapidly.<br><br>22. The accusing finger for biodiversity loss is clearly pointing to human activities.<br><br>23. The colonisation of tropical Pacific islands is said to have led to the extinction of more than 2,000 species of native birds.<br><br>24. The IUCN Red List 2004 documents the extinction of 784 species in total.<br><br>25. The 784 extinct species include 338 vertebrates, 359 invertebrates and 87 plants.<br><br>26. These extinctions documented in IUCN Red List 2004 occurred in the last five hundred years.<br><br>27. Examples of recent extinctions include the dodo from Mauritius.<br><br>28. The quagga from Africa is an example of recent extinction.<br><br>29. The thylacine from Australia is an example of recent extinction.<br><br>30. Steller's Sea Cow from Russia is an example of recent extinction.<br><br>31. Three subspecies of tiger - Bali, Javan, and Caspian - have gone extinct.<br><br>32.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Overexploitation is the third major cause in the Evil Quartet leading to biodiversity loss.<br><br>2. Many species extinctions in the last 500 years such as Stellers sea cow and passenger pigeon were due to overexploitation by humans.<br><br>3. Presently many marine fish populations around the world are over harvested endangering the continued existence of some commercially important species.<br><br>4. Alien species invasions is the third cause in the Evil Quartet when alien species are introduced unintentionally or deliberately.<br><br>5. Some alien species turn invasive and cause decline or extinction of indigenous species.<br><br>6. The Nile perch introduced into Lake Victoria in east Africa led eventually to the extinction of an ecologically unique assemblage of more than 200 species of cichlid fish.<br><br>7. Invasive weed species like carrot grass or Parthenium cause environmental damage and threat to native species.<br><br>8. Lantana is an invasive weed species that poses threat to native species.<br><br>9. Water hyacinth or Eichhornia is an invasive weed species causing environmental damage.<br><br>10. The recent illegal introduction of the African catfish Clarias gariepinus for aquaculture purposes is posing a threat to the indigenous catfishes in our rivers.<br><br>11. Co-extinctions is the fourth major cause in the Evil Quartet.<br><br>12. In co-extinctions when a species becomes extinct the plant and animal species associated with it in an obligatory way also become extinct.<br><br>13. When a host fish species becomes extinct its unique assemblage of parasites also meets the same fate.<br><br>14. In a coevolved plant-pollinator mutualism extinction of one invariably leads to the extinction of the other.<br><br>15. There are many reasons for conserving biodiversity that can be grouped into three categories: narrowly utilitarian, broadly utilitarian, and ethical.<br><br>16. The narrowly utilitarian arguments for conserving biodiversity focus on countless direct economic benefits humans derive from nature.<br><br>17. Direct economic benefits include food such as cereals, pulses and fruits.<br><br>18. Firewood, fibre and construction material are examples of direct economic benefits from nature.<br><br>19. Industrial products like tannins, lubricants, dyes, resins and perfumes are derived from nature.<br><br>20. Products of medicinal importance are among the direct economic benefits from biodiversity.<br><br>21. More than 25 per cent of the drugs currently sold in the market worldwide are derived from plants.<br><br>22. 25,000 species of plants contribute to the traditional medicines used by native peoples around the world.<br><br>23. Many more medicinally useful plants are waiting to be explored in tropical rain forests.<br><br>24. Bioprospecting involves exploring molecular, genetic and species-level diversity for products of economic importance.<br><br>25.

India now has 14 biosphere reserves, 90 national parks and 448 wildlife sanctuaries.<br><br>5. India has a history of religious and cultural traditions that emphasised protection of nature.<br><br>6. In many cultures tracts of forest were set aside and all the trees and wildlife within were venerated and given total protection.<br><br>7. Such sacred groves are found in Khasi and Jaintia Hills in Meghalaya.<br><br>8. Sacred groves are found in Aravalli Hills of Rajasthan.<br><br>9. Sacred groves are found in Western Ghat regions of Karnataka and Maharashtra.<br><br>10. Sacred groves are found in the Sarguja, Chanda and Bastar areas of Madhya Pradesh.<br><br>11. In Meghalaya the sacred groves are the last refuges for a large number of rare and threatened plants.<br><br>12. In ex situ conservation threatened animals and plants are taken out from their natural habitat and placed in special setting where they can be protected and given special care.<br><br>13. Zoological parks, botanical gardens and wildlife safari parks serve the purpose of ex situ conservation.<br><br>14. There are many animals that have become extinct in the wild but continue to be maintained in zoological parks.<br><br>15. In recent years ex situ conservation has advanced beyond keeping threatened species in enclosures.<br><br>16. Gametes of threatened species can be preserved in viable and fertile condition for long periods using cryopreservation techniques.<br><br>17. Eggs can be fertilised in vitro in advanced ex situ conservation.<br><br>18. Plants can be propagated using tissue culture methods in ex situ conservation.<br><br>19. Seeds of different genetic strains of commercially important plants can be kept for long periods in seed banks.<br><br>20. Biodiversity knows no political boundaries and its conservation is therefore a collective responsibility of all nations.<br><br>21. The historic Convention on Biological Diversity is also known as The Earth Summit.<br><br>22. The Earth Summit was held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.<br><br>23. The Earth Summit called upon all nations to take appropriate measures for conservation of biodiversity and sustainable utilisation of its benefits.<br><br>24. The World Summit on Sustainable Development was held in 2002 in Johannesburg South Africa as a follow-up to the Earth Summit.<br><br>25. 190 countries pledged their commitment at the World Summit on Sustainable Development.<br><br>26. The commitment was to achieve by 2010 a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss at global, regional and local levels."],
