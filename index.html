}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Humus is a dark coloured amorphous substance accumulated during decomposition that is highly resistant to microbial action.<br><br>2. Humus degrades further at an extremely slow rate.<br><br>3. Being colloidal in nature, humus serves as a reservoir of nutrients.<br><br>4. Humus is further degraded by some microbes and release of inorganic nutrients occurs through a process known as mineralisation.<br><br>5. Decomposition is largely an oxygen-requiring process.<br><br>6. The rate of decomposition is controlled by chemical composition of detritus and climatic factors.<br><br>7. In a particular climatic condition, decomposition rate is slower if detritus is rich in lignin and chitin.<br><br>8. Decomposition rate is quicker if detritus is rich in nitrogen and water-soluble substances like sugars.<br><br>9. Temperature and soil moisture are the most important climatic factors that regulate decomposition.<br><br>10. Temperature and soil moisture regulate decomposition through their effects on the activities of soil microbes.<br><br>11. Warm and moist environment favour decomposition.<br><br>12. Low temperature and anaerobiosis inhibit decomposition.<br><br>13. Low temperature and anaerobiosis result in build up of organic materials.<br><br>14. Humus being colloidal acts as a reservoir of nutrients in the soil.<br><br>15. Mineralisation involves the release of inorganic nutrients from humus by microbial degradation.<br><br>16. The chemical composition of detritus determines the rate at which it decomposes.<br><br>17. Lignin and chitin are resistant compounds that slow down decomposition.<br><br>18. Nitrogen-rich and sugar-rich detritus decomposes more quickly than lignin-rich detritus.<br><br>19. Anaerobiosis refers to the absence or lack of oxygen which inhibits decomposition.<br><br>20.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. India has only 2.4 per cent of the world's land area but its share of the global species diversity is an impressive 8.1 per cent.<br><br>2. India is one of the 12 mega diversity countries of the world.<br><br>3. Nearly 45,000 species of plants and twice as many animals have been recorded from India.<br><br>4. If only 22 per cent of total species have been recorded so far, there are probably more than 1,00,000 plant species and more than 3,00,000 animal species yet to be discovered in India.<br><br>5. A large fraction of species faces the threat of becoming extinct even before we discover them.<br><br>6. The diversity of plants and animals is not uniform throughout the world but shows an uneven distribution.<br><br>7. The most well-known pattern in biodiversity is the latitudinal gradient in diversity.<br><br>8. In general, species diversity decreases as we move away from the equator towards the poles.<br><br>9. Tropics with latitudinal range of 23.5 degree N to 23.5 degree S harbor more species than temperate or polar zones with very few exceptions.<br><br>10. Colombia located near the equator has nearly 1,400 species of birds while New York at 41 degree N has 105 species and Greenland at 71 degree N has only 56 species.<br><br>11. India, with much of its land area in tropical latitude, has more than 1,200 species of birds.<br><br>12. A forest in Ecuador has up to 10 times as many species of vascular plants, 90 times as many insect species, and 25 times as many amphibian species as a comparable area in the Midwest of USA.<br><br>13. The Amazonian rain forest in South America has the greatest biodiversity on earth.<br><br>14. Amazonian rain forest is home to more than 40,000 species of plants, 3,000 of fishes, 1,300 of birds, 427 of mammals, 427 of amphibians, 378 of reptiles and over 1,25,000 invertebrates.<br><br>15. Scientists estimate that in Amazonian rain forests there might be at least 2 million insect species waiting to be discovered and named.<br><br>16. Speciation is generally a function of time.<br><br>17. Unlike temperate regions that were subjected to frequent glaciations in the past, tropical latitudes have remained relatively undisturbed for millions of years and thus had a long evolutionary time for species diversification.<br><br>18. Nature's biological library is burning even before we catalogue the titles of all the books stocked there, referring to species extinction before discovery."],
