  }], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Table 11.1 shows six types of population interactions based on the effects on Species A and Species B.<br><br>2. When both Species A and B show plus sign, the interaction is mutualism where both species benefit.<br><br>3. When both Species A and B show minus sign, the interaction is competition where both species lose.<br><br>4. When Species A shows plus and Species B shows minus, the interaction is either predation or parasitism.<br><br>5. In predation, the predator benefits and the prey is harmed.<br><br>6. In parasitism, the parasite benefits and the host is harmed.<br><br>7. When Species A shows plus and Species B shows zero, the interaction is commensalism.<br><br>8. In commensalism, one species is benefitted and the other is neither benefitted nor harmed.<br><br>9. When Species A shows minus and Species B shows zero, the interaction is amensalism.<br><br>10. In amensalism, one species is harmed whereas the other is unaffected.<br><br>11. Both species benefit in mutualism and both lose in competition in their interactions with each other.<br><br>12. In both parasitism and predation, only one species benefits (parasite and predator respectively) and the interaction is detrimental to the other species (host and prey respectively).<br><br>13. Predation, parasitism and commensalism share a common characteristic: the interacting species live closely together.<br><br>14. Predation can be thought of as nature's way of transferring to higher trophic levels the energy fixed by plants.<br><br>15. When we think of predator and prey, probably it is the tiger and the deer that readily come to our mind.<br><br>16. A sparrow eating any seed is no less a predator than a tiger eating deer.<br><br>17. Although animals eating plants are categorised separately as herbivores, they are in a broad ecological context not very different from predators.<br><br>18. Besides acting as conduits for energy transfer across trophic levels, predators play other important roles.<br><br>19. Predators keep prey populations under control.<br><br>20. Without predators, prey species could achieve very high population densities and cause ecosystem instability.<br><br>21. When certain exotic species are introduced into a geographical area, they become invasive and start spreading fast because the invaded land does not have its natural predators.<br><br>22. The prickly pear cactus introduced into Australia in the early 1920's caused havoc by spreading rapidly into millions of hectares of rangeland.<br><br>23. The invasive prickly pear cactus was brought under control only after a cactus-feeding predator (a moth) from its natural habitat was introduced into the country.<br><br>24. Biological control methods adopted in agricultural pest control are based on the ability of the predator to control pest populations."],

Identification and enumeration of plant and animal species of an ecosystem gives its species composition.<br><br>3. Vertical distribution of different species occupying different levels is called stratification.<br><br>4. In a forest, trees occupy top vertical strata or layer, shrubs the second and herbs and grasses occupy the bottom layers.<br><br>5. The four aspects that make ecosystem components function as a unit are productivity, decomposition, energy flow and nutrient cycling.<br><br>6. A pond is a shallow water body in which all the four basic components of an ecosystem are well exhibited.<br><br>7. The abiotic component of a pond includes water with all dissolved inorganic and organic substances and the rich soil deposit at the bottom.<br><br>8. The solar input, the cycle of temperature, day-length and other climatic conditions regulate the rate of function of the entire pond.<br><br>9. The autotrophic components of a pond include phytoplankton, some algae and the floating, submerged and marginal plants found at the edges.<br><br>10. The consumers in a pond are represented by the zooplankton, the free swimming and bottom dwelling forms.<br><br>11. The decomposers of a pond are fungi, bacteria and flagellates especially abundant in the bottom.<br><br>12. A pond system performs all the functions of any ecosystem and of the biosphere as a whole.<br><br>13. In an ecosystem, conversion of inorganic into organic material occurs with the help of radiant energy of the sun by the autotrophs.<br><br>14. Consumption of autotrophs by heterotrophs is a function performed in ecosystems.<br><br>15. Decomposition and mineralisation of dead matter occurs to release them back for reuse by the autotrophs.<br><br>16. The events of conversion, consumption and decomposition are repeated over and over again in an ecosystem.<br><br>17. There is unidirectional flow of energy from solar or chemical energy to heat energy at each trophic level.<br><br>18. Energy dissipation and loss as heat to the environment occurs at each trophic level.<br><br>19. A constant input of solar energy is the basic requirement for any ecosystem to function and sustain.<br><br>20.

Tropical environments are less seasonal, relatively more constant and predictable compared to temperate ones.<br><br>3. Such constant environments in the tropics promote niche specialisation.<br><br>4. Niche specialisation in tropical environments leads to greater species diversity.<br><br>5. There is more solar energy available in the tropics which contributes to higher productivity.<br><br>6. Higher productivity in the tropics in turn might contribute to greater diversity.<br><br>7. Alexander von Humboldt was a great German naturalist and geographer who studied species-area relationships.<br><br>8. During his pioneering and extensive explorations in the wilderness of South American jungles, Humboldt observed species-area relationships.<br><br>9. Within a region, species richness increased with increasing explored area, but only up to a limit.<br><br>10. The relation between species richness and area for a wide variety of taxa turns out to be a rectangular hyperbola.<br><br>11. The taxa for which this relationship was observed include angiosperm plants, birds, bats, and freshwater fishes.<br><br>12. On a logarithmic scale, the species-area relationship is a straight line described by the equation log S = log C + Z log A.<br><br>13. In the species-area equation, S represents species richness.<br><br>14. In the species-area equation, A represents area.<br><br>15. In the species-area equation, Z represents the slope of the line or regression coefficient.<br><br>16. In the species-area equation, C represents the Y-intercept.<br><br>17. Ecologists have discovered that the value of Z is in the range of 0.1 to 0.2.<br><br>18. The Z value of 0.1 to 0.2 holds regardless of the taxonomic group or the region.<br><br>19. The slopes of the regression line are amazingly similar whether it is plants in Britain, birds in California, or molluscs in New York state.<br><br>20. If species-area relationships are analysed among very large areas like entire continents, the slope of the line is much steeper.<br><br>21. For entire continents, Z values are in the range of 0.6 to 1.2.<br><br>22. For frugivorous (fruit-eating) birds and mammals in the tropical forests of different continents, the slope is found to be 1.15.<br><br>23. Steeper slopes in species-area relationships mean a faster increase in species richness with increasing area.<br><br>24.

More than 15,500 species worldwide are currently facing the threat of extinction.<br><br>3. Presently 12 per cent of all bird species in the world face the threat of extinction.<br><br>4. Presently 23 per cent of all mammal species in the world face the threat of extinction.<br><br>5. Presently 32 per cent of all amphibian species in the world face the threat of extinction.<br><br>6. Presently 31 per cent of all gymnosperm species in the world face the threat of extinction.<br><br>7. From fossil records we learn that large-scale loss of species like the one we are currently witnessing have also happened earlier even before humans appeared on the scene.<br><br>8. During the long period of more than 3 billion years since the origin and diversification of life on earth there were five episodes of mass extinction of species.<br><br>9. The Sixth Extinction is presently in progress.<br><br>10. The Sixth Extinction is different from previous episodes in the rates of extinction.<br><br>11. The current species extinction rates are estimated to be 100 to 1,000 times faster than in the pre-human times.<br><br>12. Our activities or human activities are responsible for the faster rates of extinction.<br><br>13. Ecologists warn that if present trends continue nearly half of all the species on earth might be wiped out within the next 100 years.<br><br>14. Loss of biodiversity in a region may lead to decline in plant production.<br><br>15. Loss of biodiversity may lead to lowered resistance to environmental perturbations such as drought.<br><br>16. Loss of biodiversity may lead to increased variability in certain ecosystem processes such as plant productivity, water use, and pest and disease cycles.<br><br>17. The accelerated rates of species extinctions that the world is facing now are largely due to human activities.<br><br>18. There are four major causes of biodiversity losses collectively called The Evil Quartet.<br><br>19. Habitat loss and fragmentation is the most important cause driving animals and plants to extinction among the Evil Quartet.<br><br>20. The most dramatic examples of habitat loss come from tropical rain forests.<br><br>21. Tropical rain forests once covered more than 14 per cent of the earth's land surface.<br><br>22. Tropical rain forests now cover no more than 6 per cent of the earth's land surface.<br><br>23. Tropical rain forests are being destroyed fast.<br><br>24. By the time you finish reading the chapter on biodiversity 1,000 more hectares of rain forest would have been lost.<br><br>25. The Amazon rain forest is so huge that it is called the lungs of the planet.<br><br>26. The Amazon rain forest harbouring probably millions of species is being cut and cleared for cultivating soya beans.<br><br>27. The Amazon rain forest is also being converted to grasslands for raising beef cattle.<br><br>28. Besides total loss the degradation of many habitats by pollution also threatens the survival of many species.<br><br>29. When large habitats are broken up into small fragments due to various human activities mammals and birds requiring large territories are badly affected.<br><br>30. Habitat fragmentation badly affects certain animals with migratory habits leading to population declines.<br><br>31. Over-exploitation is the second major cause in the Evil Quartet.<br><br>32.

Pollination is an ecosystem service provided by pollinators like bees, bumblebees, birds and bats.<br><br>3. Without natural pollinators the costs of accomplishing pollination would be very high.<br><br>4. Intangible benefits we derive from nature include aesthetic pleasures of walking through thick woods, watching spring flowers in full bloom or waking up to a bulbuls song in the morning.<br><br>5. The ethical argument for conserving biodiversity relates to what we owe to millions of plant, animal and microbe species with whom we share this planet.<br><br>6. Philosophically or spiritually we need to realise that every species has an intrinsic value.<br><br>7. Every species has intrinsic value even if it may not be of current or any economic value to us.<br><br>8. We have a moral duty to care for the well-being of species and pass on our biological legacy in good order to future generations.<br><br>9. In situ conservation means on site conservation where we conserve and protect the whole ecosystem.<br><br>10. When we save the entire forest to save the tiger this approach is called in situ conservation.<br><br>11. Ex situ conservation means off site conservation.<br><br>12. When an animal or plant is endangered or threatened and needs urgent measures to save it from extinction ex situ conservation is the desirable approach.<br><br>13. Endangered or threatened organisms are at a very high risk of extinction in the wild in the near future.<br><br>14. Many nations find it unrealistic and economically not feasible to conserve all their biological wealth.<br><br>15. The number of species waiting to be saved far exceeds the conservable resources available.<br><br>16. Conservationists identified certain biodiversity hotspots for maximum protection.<br><br>17. Biodiversity hotspots are regions with very high levels of species richness and high degree of endemism.<br><br>18. Endemism means species confined to that region and not found anywhere else.<br><br>19. Initially 25 biodiversity hotspots were identified.<br><br>20. Subsequently nine more hotspots have been added bringing the total number of biodiversity hotspots in the world to 34.<br><br>21. Biodiversity hotspots are also regions of accelerated habitat loss.<br><br>22. Three biodiversity hotspots cover Indias exceptionally high biodiversity regions: Western Ghats and Sri Lanka, Indo-Burma and Himalaya.<br><br>23. All the biodiversity hotspots put together cover less than 2 per cent of the earths land area.<br><br>24.
