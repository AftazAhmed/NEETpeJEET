Modern biotechnology in restricted sense refers to processes that use genetically modified organisms to achieve production on a larger scale.<br><br>4. The European Federation of Biotechnology provided a comprehensive definition of biotechnology.<br><br>5. EFB definition encompasses both traditional view and modern molecular biotechnology.<br><br>6. According to EFB, biotechnology is the integration of natural science and organisms, cells, parts thereof, and molecular analogues for products and services.<br><br>7. Many biotechnology processes do not necessarily utilize genetically modified organisms.<br><br>8. Test-tube baby production is considered part of modern biotechnology.<br><br>9. Synthesizing a gene artificially is a biotechnology process.<br><br>10. Developing a DNA vaccine is an application of biotechnology.<br><br>11. Correcting a defective gene through gene therapy is part of biotechnology.<br><br>12. Two core techniques enabled the birth of modern biotechnology.<br><br>13. Genetic engineering is the first core technique of modern biotechnology.<br><br>14. Genetic engineering involves techniques to alter the chemistry of genetic material.<br><br>15. Both DNA and RNA can be altered through genetic engineering techniques.<br><br>16. The EFB definition bridges the gap between traditional fermentation-based processes and modern molecular approaches.<br><br>17.

Recombinant DNA technology, Polymerase Chain Reaction or PCR, and Enzyme Linked Immuno-sorbent Assay or ELISA are techniques that serve the purpose of early diagnosis.<br><br>3. Presence of a pathogen like bacteria or viruses is normally suspected only when the pathogen has produced a disease symptom, by which time the concentration of pathogen is already very high in the body.<br><br>4. Very low concentration of bacteria or virus, at a time when symptoms are not yet visible, can be detected by amplification of their nucleic acid by PCR.<br><br>5. PCR is now routinely used to detect HIV in suspected AIDS patients.<br><br>6. PCR is being used to detect mutations in genes in suspected cancer patients.<br><br>7. PCR is a powerful technique to identify many genetic disorders.<br><br>8. In molecular diagnosis, a single stranded DNA or RNA tagged with a radioactive molecule called probe is allowed to hybridise to its complementary DNA in a clone of cells followed by detection using autoradiography.<br><br>9. The clone having the mutated gene will not appear on the photographic film because the probe will not have complementarity with the mutated gene.<br><br>10. ELISA is based on the principle of antigen-antibody interaction.<br><br>11.

At any level of biological organisation, two types of questions can be asked - how-type and why-type questions.<br><br>5. How-type questions seek the mechanism behind the biological process being studied.<br><br>6. Why-type questions seek the significance of the biological process being studied.<br><br>7. Example of how-type question - How does the bird sing can be answered in terms of operation of voice box and vibrating bone.<br><br>8. Example of why-type question - Why does the bird sing can be answered in terms of need to communicate with mate during breeding season.<br><br>9. Observing nature with a scientific frame of mind leads to generation of many interesting questions of both types.<br><br>10.

Natality and immigration are two processes that contribute to an increase in population density.<br><br>3. Mortality and emigration are two processes that contribute to a decrease in population density.<br><br>4. Natality refers to number of births during given period in population that are added to initial density.<br><br>5. Mortality is the number of deaths in the population during a given period.<br><br>6. Immigration is the number of individuals of same species that have come into habitat from elsewhere during time period under consideration.<br><br>7. Emigration is the number of individuals of population who left habitat and gone elsewhere during time period under consideration.<br><br>8. If N is population density at time t, then density at time t+1 is given by equation Nt+1 = Nt + [(B + I) - (D + E)].<br><br>9. In the equation, B represents natality or births, I represents immigration, D represents mortality or deaths, and E represents emigration.<br><br>10. Population density will increase if number of births plus number of immigrants (B+I) is more than number of deaths plus number of emigrants (D+E).<br><br>11. Under normal conditions, births and deaths are the most important factors influencing population density.<br><br>12. Immigration and emigration assume importance only under special conditions in affecting population density.<br><br>13. If a new habitat is just being colonised, immigration may contribute more significantly to population growth than birth rates.<br><br>14.

Figure 11.2 shows flow diagram with natality and immigration adding to population density while mortality and emigration reduce it.<br><br>18. The population growth equation demonstrates that population size at next time interval depends on current density plus net change from four basic processes.<br><br>19. In special conditions like habitat colonization, immigration becomes more important than normal births in contributing to population growth.<br><br>20. The four basic processes - natality, mortality, immigration and emigration - together determine changes in population density over any given time period."],

In interspecific competition, feeding rate can be reduced due to interfering and inhibitory presence of other species even if resources are abundant.<br><br>3. Fitness of one species measured in terms of r (intrinsic rate of increase) is significantly lower in presence of another competing species.<br><br>4. In laboratory experiments by Gause, when two species compete for same limiting resources, competitively superior species will eventually eliminate inferior species.<br><br>5. Evidence for competitive exclusion from field studies is much more circumstantial compared to laboratory experiments.<br><br>6. Abingdon tortoise in Galapagos Islands became extinct within a decade after goats were introduced, apparently due to greater browsing efficiency of goats.<br><br>7. Competitive release is when species whose distribution is restricted expands its range dramatically when competing species is experimentally removed.<br><br>8. Connells elegant field experiments showed that on rocky sea coasts of Scotland, larger barnacle Balanus dominates and excludes smaller barnacle Chathamalus from that zone.<br><br>9. In general, herbivores and plants appear to be more adversely affected by competition than carnivores.<br><br>10. Gauses Competitive Exclusion Principle states that two closely related species competing for same resources cannot co-exist indefinitely.<br><br>11. According to Gauses principle, the competitively inferior species will be eliminated eventually.<br><br>12. Gauses principle may be true if resources are limiting, but not otherwise.<br><br>13.

MacArthur showed that five closely related species of warblers living on same tree were able to avoid competition and co-exist.<br><br>18. MacArthur warblers coexisted due to behavioural differences in their foraging activities as example of resource partitioning.<br><br>19. Competitive release demonstrates that presence of competitively superior species can restrict distribution of inferior species.<br><br>20. When competitively superior species is removed, previously restricted species can expand its distributional range dramatically.<br><br>21. Balanus barnacle is larger and competitively superior to Chathamalus barnacle in Connells experiments.<br><br>22. Resource partitioning allows species to use same resource in different ways, times or locations to avoid direct competition.<br><br>23.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. The most spectacular and evolutionarily fascinating examples of mutualism are found in plant-animal relationships.<br><br>2. Plants need the help of animals for pollinating their flowers and dispersing their seeds.<br><br>3. Animals obviously have to be paid fees for the services that plants expect from them.<br><br>4. Plants offer rewards or fees in form of pollen and nectar for pollinators and juicy nutritious fruits for seed dispersers.<br><br>5. The mutually beneficial plant-animal system should be safeguarded against cheaters like animals that try to steal nectar without aiding in pollination.<br><br>6. Plant-animal interactions often involve co-evolution of the mutualists, meaning evolutions of flower and its pollinator species are tightly linked with one another.<br><br>7. In many species of fig trees, there is a tight one-to-one relationship with the pollinator species of wasp as shown in Figure 11.4.<br><br>8. A given fig species can be pollinated only by its partner wasp species and no other species showing high specificity.<br><br>9. The female wasp uses the fig fruit not only as an oviposition or egg-laying site but also uses developing seeds within fruit for nourishing its larvae.<br><br>10. The wasp pollinates the fig inflorescence while searching for suitable egg-laying sites in the fruit.<br><br>11. In return for the favour of pollination, the fig offers the wasp some of its developing seeds as food for developing wasp larvae.<br><br>12. Orchids show a bewildering diversity of floral patterns many of which have evolved to attract the right pollinator insect.<br><br>13. Orchid floral patterns ensure guaranteed pollination by the right pollinator insect like bees and bumblebees.<br><br>14. Not all orchids offer rewards to their pollinators.<br><br>15. The Mediterranean orchid Ophrys employs sexual deceit to get pollination done by a species of bee.<br><br>16. In Ophrys orchid, one petal of its flower bears an uncanny resemblance to the female of the bee in size, colour and markings.<br><br>17. The male bee is attracted to Ophrys flower because it perceives it as a female bee.<br><br>18. The male bee pseudocopulates with the Ophrys orchid flower and during that process is dusted with pollen from the flower.<br><br>19. When the same male bee pseudocopulates with another Ophrys flower, it transfers pollen to it and thus pollinates the flower.<br><br>20. Co-evolution operates in Ophrys-bee relationship - if female bee colour patterns change even slightly, pollination success will be reduced unless orchid flower co-evolves.<br><br>21. The orchid flower must co-evolve to maintain the resemblance of its petal to the female bee for successful pollination.<br><br>22. Figure 11.5 shows a bee acting as a pollinator on orchid flower.<br><br>23. Cheaters in plant-animal mutualism are animals that exploit plant rewards without providing pollination services in return.<br><br>24. The tight one-to-one relationship between fig species and specific wasp species demonstrates highly specialized co-evolution.<br><br>25. Sexual deceit in Ophrys orchid is an example of how plants have evolved specialized mechanisms to ensure pollination without offering rewards."],
