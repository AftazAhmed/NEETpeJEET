Diversity in the biosphere exists at all levels ranging from macromolecules within cells to biomes.<br><br>5. Immense diversity or heterogeneity exists not only at the species level but at all levels of biological organisation.<br><br>6. There are more than 20,000 species of ants present on Earth.<br><br>7. Approximately 3,00,000 species of beetles exist, making them one of the most diverse groups of organisms.<br><br>8.

The rich variety of living organisms never ceases to astonish and fascinate humans.<br><br>11. Ecologists and evolutionary biologists study biodiversity to understand its significance.<br><br>12. Important questions about biodiversity include why there are so many species on Earth.<br><br>13. Scientists investigate whether such great diversity existed throughout Earth's history.<br><br>14.

India is one of the 12 mega diversity countries of the world.<br><br>3. Nearly 45,000 species of plants have been recorded from India.<br><br>4. Twice as many animals as plants have been recorded from India meaning approximately 90,000 animal species.<br><br>5. According to May's global estimates, only 22 per cent of total species have been recorded so far.<br><br>6. Applying May's proportion to India, more than 1,00,000 plant species are yet to be discovered and described.<br><br>7. More than 3,00,000 animal species in India are yet to be discovered and described.<br><br>8. A large fraction of species faces the threat of becoming extinct even before we discover them.<br><br>9. The metaphor Nature's biological library is burning refers to species extinction before cataloguing.<br><br>10. Latitudinal gradient in diversity is the most well-known pattern of biodiversity.<br><br>11. The diversity of plants and animals is not uniform throughout the world but shows uneven distribution.<br><br>12. Species diversity decreases as we move away from the equator towards the poles.<br><br>13. With very few exceptions, tropics harbour more species than temperate or polar areas.<br><br>14. Tropics have a latitudinal range of 23.5 degree N to 23.5 degree S.<br><br>15. Colombia located near the equator has nearly 1,400 species of birds.<br><br>16. New York at 41 degree N has 105 species of birds.<br><br>17. Greenland at 71 degree N has only 56 species of birds.<br><br>18. India with much of its land area in tropical latitudes has more than 1,200 species of birds.<br><br>19. A tropical forest in Ecuador has up to 10 times as many vascular plant species as a temperate forest of equal area.<br><br>20. The Amazonian rain forest in South America has the greatest biodiversity on earth.<br><br>21. The Amazonian rain forest is home to more than 40,000 species of plants.<br><br>22.

Speciation is generally a function of time according to ecologists and evolutionary biologists.<br><br>26.
