Mammary glands are paired structures (breasts) containing glandular tissue and variable amount of fat.<br><br>3. Glandular tissue of each breast is divided into 15-20 mammary lobes.<br><br>4. Mammary lobes contain clusters of cells called alveoli.<br><br>5. Cells of alveoli secrete milk which is stored in cavities (lumens) of alveoli.<br><br>6. Alveoli open into mammary tubules.<br><br>7. Tubules of each lobe join to form a mammary duct.<br><br>8. Several mammary ducts join to form a wider mammary ampulla.<br><br>9. Mammary ampulla is connected to lactiferous duct which opens at the nipple.<br><br>10. Milk is expressed from nipple during breastfeeding.<br><br>11. Correct sequence from alveoli to nipple: Alveoli - Mammary tubules - Mammary duct - Mammary ampulla - Lactiferous duct - Nipple.<br><br>12. Testis in males and ovaries in females are primary sex organs that produce gametes.<br><br>13. Gametogenesis is the process of formation of gametes in primary sex organs.<br><br>14. Spermatogenesis is the process by which immature male germ cells (spermatogonia) produce sperms.<br><br>15. Spermatogenesis begins at puberty.<br><br>16. Spermatogonia are present on inside wall of seminiferous tubules.<br><br>17. Spermatogonia multiply by mitotic division and increase in numbers.<br><br>18. Each spermatogonium is diploid and contains 46 chromosomes.<br><br>19. Some spermatogonia called primary spermatocytes periodically undergo meiosis.<br><br>20. Primary spermatocyte completes first meiotic division (reduction division) to form two equal haploid secondary spermatocytes.<br><br>21. Secondary spermatocytes have only 23 chromosomes each.<br><br>22. Secondary spermatocytes undergo second meiotic division to produce four equal haploid spermatids.<br><br>23. Spermatids have 23 chromosomes.<br><br>24. Spermatids are transformed into spermatozoa (sperms) by the process called spermiogenesis.<br><br>25. After spermiogenesis, sperm heads become embedded in Sertoli cells.<br><br>26. Sperms are finally released from seminiferous tubules by the process called spermiation.<br><br>27. Spermatogenesis starts at puberty due to significant increase in secretion of GnRH (Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone).<br><br>28. GnRH is a hypothalamic hormone.<br><br>29. Increased levels of GnRH act on anterior pituitary gland and stimulate secretion of two gonadotropins - LH and FSH.<br><br>30.

In male gametes (sperms), the sex chromosome could be either X or Y.<br><br>7. 50 per cent of sperms carry X chromosome while other 50 per cent carry Y chromosome.<br><br>8. After fusion of male and female gametes, zygote would carry either XX or XY.<br><br>9. If sperm carrying X fertilises ovum, zygote carries XX and develops as female baby.<br><br>10. If sperm carrying Y fertilises ovum, zygote carries XY and develops as male baby.<br><br>11. Scientifically, the sex of baby is determined by father and not by mother.<br><br>12. The father produces two types of gametes (X-bearing and Y-bearing sperms) hence determines sex.<br><br>13. Mitotic division that starts as zygote moves through isthmus of oviduct is called cleavage.<br><br>14. Cleavage occurs as zygote moves towards uterus.<br><br>15. Cleavage forms 2, 4, 8, 16 daughter cells called blastomeres.<br><br>16. All cleavage divisions are mitotic divisions.<br><br>17. The embryo with 8 to 16 blastomeres is called morula.<br><br>18. Morula is formed as embryo passes through isthmus of fallopian tube.<br><br>19. Zygote carrying XX chromosomes develops as female baby.<br><br>20. Zygote carrying XY chromosomes develops as male baby.<br><br>21. The type of sex determination in humans is XX-XY type.<br><br>22. Human female is homogametic (produces one type of gamete with X).<br><br>23. Human male is heterogametic (produces two types of gametes with X or Y).<br><br>24. Sex determination occurs at fertilisation not at birth or later stages.<br><br>25. Cleavage converts single-celled zygote into multicellular morula through mitotic divisions."],

Periodic abstinence is a natural method in which couples avoid or abstain from coitus from day 10 to 17 of menstrual cycle when ovulation could be expected.<br><br>3. Period from day 10 to 17 of menstrual cycle is called fertile period as chances of fertilisation are very high during this period.<br><br>4. Withdrawal or coitus interruptus is a method in which male partner withdraws his penis from vagina just before ejaculation to avoid insemination.<br><br>5. Lactational amenorrhea method is based on the fact that ovulation and menstrual cycle do not occur during period of intense lactation following parturition.<br><br>6. Lactational amenorrhea method is effective only upto maximum period of six months following parturition as long as mother breast-feeds child fully.<br><br>7. In all natural methods, side effects are almost nil but chances of failure are high.<br><br>8. In barrier methods, ovum and sperms are prevented from physically meeting with help of barriers.<br><br>9. Barrier methods are available for both males and females.<br><br>10. Condoms are barriers made of thin rubber or latex sheath used to cover penis in male or vagina and cervix in female just before coitus.<br><br>11. Condoms prevent ejaculated semen from entering female reproductive tract and thus prevent conception.<br><br>12. Nirodh is a popular brand of condom for the male.<br><br>13.

Inheritance is the process by which characters are passed on from parent to progeny and forms the basis of heredity.<br><br>3. Variation is defined as the degree by which progeny differ from their parents.<br><br>4. Offspring show both similarities to parents due to inheritance and differences due to variation.<br><br>5. Sexual reproduction was recognized as a cause of variation as early as 8000-1000 B.C. by humans.<br><br>6. Artificial selection is the process of selectively breeding organisms with desirable characters from wild populations.<br><br>7. Domestication involves selecting and breeding organisms from ancestral wild populations to enhance favorable traits.<br><br>8. Natural variations present in wild populations of plants and animals were exploited by early humans for selective breeding.<br><br>9. Species-specific inheritance ensures that offspring are always of the same species as their parents (elephant gives birth to elephant, mango seed forms mango plant).<br><br>10.

Gametes of tall TT plants have the allele T and gametes of dwarf tt plants have the allele t.<br><br>5. During fertilisation, alleles T from one parent and t from the other parent unite through the egg to produce zygotes with one T allele and one t allele (Tt).<br><br>6. Hybrids (Tt) contain alleles which segregate at the time of gamete formation during meiosis.<br><br>7. Punnett Square is a graphical representation developed by British geneticist Reginald C. Punnett to calculate the probability of all possible genotypes of offspring in a genetic cross.<br><br>8. In a Punnett square, possible gametes are written on two sides, usually the top row and left columns, and all possible combinations are represented in boxes within the square.<br><br>9. When a Tt plant is self-pollinated, it produces gametes of genotype T and t in equal proportion.<br><br>10. During fertilisation in Tt self-pollination, pollen grains of genotype T have a 50 per cent chance to pollinate eggs of genotype T as well as genotype t.<br><br>11. Similarly, pollen grains of genotype t have a 50 per cent chance of pollinating eggs of genotype T as well as genotype t.<br><br>12. The recessive parental trait is expressed without any blending in F2 generation, proving that alleles remain distinct and segregate during reproduction.<br><br>13. The segregation of alleles has been verified by the results of crossings showing predictable ratios in offspring."],

In co-dominance, the F1 generation resembles both parents, unlike dominance or incomplete dominance.<br><br>6. ABO blood grouping in humans is controlled by the gene I and is a classic example of multiple allelism and co-dominance.<br><br>7. The plasma membrane of red blood cells has sugar polymers that protrude from its surface, and the kind of sugar is controlled by the I gene.<br><br>8. The gene I has three alleles: IA, IB, and i.<br><br>9. Alleles IA and IB produce slightly different forms of sugar polymers, while allele i does not produce any sugar.<br><br>10. IA and IB are completely dominant over i; when IA and i are present, only IA expresses, and when IB and i are present, IB expresses.<br><br>11. When IA and IB are present together, they both express their own types of sugars due to co-dominance, resulting in blood group AB.<br><br>12. Because humans are diploid organisms, each person possesses any two of the three I gene alleles.<br><br>13. Since there are three different alleles (IA, IB, i), there are six different combinations possible, resulting in six different genotypes for ABO blood types.<br><br>14. The six genotypes are: IAIA (A), IAIB (AB), IAi (A), IBIB (B), IBi (B), and ii (O).<br><br>15. The four phenotypes (blood groups) are: A, B, AB, and O.<br><br>16. Red blood cells have both A and B types of sugars in blood group AB due to co-dominance."],

The behavior of chromosomes parallels the behavior of genes, providing physical evidence for Mendels laws.<br><br>5. During Anaphase of meiosis I, the two chromosome pairs can align at the metaphase plate independently of each other.<br><br>6. Independent assortment of chromosomes means different chromosome pairs can segregate in different combinations.<br><br>7. In Possibility I, orange and green chromosomes segregate together to one pole while yellow and red go to the other pole.<br><br>8. In Possibility II, orange and red chromosomes segregate together to one pole while yellow and green go to the other pole.<br><br>9. The different possibilities of chromosome alignment during meiosis I demonstrate independent assortment at the chromosomal level.<br><br>10. Meiosis I anaphase is followed by Meiosis II anaphase, which further separates sister chromatids to produce four different germ cells.<br><br>11. The independent alignment and segregation of chromosome pairs during meiosis provides the physical basis for Mendels Law of Independent Assortment.<br><br>12. Comparing chromosomes of four different colors in left and right columns shows how independent assortment produces different gamete combinations."],

During spermatogenesis, 50 per cent of sperm carry X-chromosome and 50 per cent carry Y-chromosome besides autosomes.<br><br>8. Human females produce only one type of ovum with an X-chromosome.<br><br>9. There is equal probability of fertilisation of ovum with sperm carrying either X or Y chromosome.<br><br>10. Fertilisation of ovum with X-carrying sperm produces female offspring (XX), while fertilisation with Y-carrying sperm produces male offspring (XY).<br><br>11. The genetic makeup of the sperm determines the sex of the child in humans.<br><br>12. In each pregnancy, there is always 50 per cent probability of either a male or female child.<br><br>13. Sex determination in honey bee is based on the number of sets of chromosomes an individual receives, called haplodiploid system.<br><br>14. In honey bees, fertilised eggs develop as females (queen or worker) which are diploid with 32 chromosomes.<br><br>15. Unfertilised eggs in honey bees develop as males (drones) by parthenogenesis, which are haploid with 16 chromosomes.<br><br>16. Males in honey bees have half the number of chromosomes than females.<br><br>17. Male honey bees produce sperms by mitosis, not meiosis.<br><br>18. Male honey bees do not have father and thus cannot have sons, but have a grandfather and can have grandsons."],

In phenylketonuria, the affected individual lacks an enzyme that converts phenylalanine into tyrosine.<br><br>5. Phenylalanine accumulates and is converted into phenylpyruvic acid and other derivatives in phenylketonuria.<br><br>6. Accumulation of phenylpyruvic acid and derivatives in brain results in mental retardation.<br><br>7.

Thalassemia defect results in reduced rate of synthesis of one of the globin chains (alpha or beta) that make up haemoglobin.<br><br>10. Thalassemia causes formation of abnormal haemoglobin molecules resulting in anaemia.<br><br>11. In alpha Thalassemia, production of alpha globin chain is affected; in beta Thalassemia, production of beta globin chain is affected.<br><br>12. Alpha Thalassemia is controlled by two closely linked genes HBA1 and HBA2 on chromosome 16 of each parent.<br><br>13. Beta Thalassemia is controlled by a single gene HBB on chromosome 11 of each parent.<br><br>14.

Differences in 0.1% of DNA sequence (approximately 3 million bp out of 3 billion bp) make every individual unique.<br><br>3. DNA fingerprinting is a very quick way to compare DNA sequences of any two individuals.<br><br>4. DNA fingerprinting involves identifying differences in specific regions called repetitive DNA.<br><br>5. In repetitive DNA, a small stretch of DNA is repeated many times.<br><br>6. Repetitive DNA sequences are separated from bulk genomic DNA during density gradient centrifugation.<br><br>7. Bulk DNA forms a major peak; other small peaks are satellite DNA.<br><br>8. Satellite DNA is classified into categories like micro-satellite and mini-satellites based on number of repeating units.<br><br>9. Repetitive sequences normally do not code for any proteins.<br><br>10. Repetitive sequences form a large portion of human genome.<br><br>11. Repetitive sequences show high degree of polymorphism.<br><br>12. DNA from every tissue from an individual shows the same degree of polymorphism.<br><br>13. Polymorphisms are inheritable from parents to children.<br><br>14. DNA fingerprinting is the basis of paternity testing in cases of disputed paternity.<br><br>15. Polymorphism is variation at genetic level arising due to mutations.<br><br>16. Polymorphism is inheritable mutation.<br><br>17. If mutation arises in somatic cell, it will not be inherited.<br><br>18. If mutation takes place in germ cells (cells that generate gametes), it can be transmitted to offspring.<br><br>19. New mutations may arise in somatic cells or in germ cells.<br><br>20. Satellite DNA classification depends on the number of repeating units."]}},

Spores is the unit, and it was favourite idea for some astronomers.<br><br>23. For long time it was believed that life came from outer space.<br><br>24. Some scientists believe that life came from outside earth.<br><br>25. Theory of life from spores was called theory of spontaneous generation.<br><br>26. Louis Pasteur by careful experimentation demonstrated that life comes only from pre-existing life.<br><br>27. Pasteur showed that in pre-sterilised flasks, life did not come from killed yeast.<br><br>28. In similar flasks open to air, new living organisms arose from dead yeast.<br><br>29.

}], " NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Every population has built in variation in characteristics.<br><br>2. Those characteristics which enable some to survive better in natural conditions would outbreed others.<br><br>3. Natural conditions include climate, food, physical factors etc.<br><br>4. Another word used is fitness of individual or population.<br><br>5. Fitness according to Darwin refers ultimately and only to reproductive fitness.<br><br>6. Those who are better fit in environment leave more progeny than others.<br><br>7. Better fit organisms will survive more and hence are selected by nature.<br><br>8. Darwin called it natural selection.<br><br>9. Darwin implied natural selection as mechanism of evolution.<br><br>10. Alfred Russell Wallace, a naturalist who worked in Malay Archipelago, came to similar conclusions around same time.<br><br>11. Natural selection is equivalent to differential reproduction.<br><br>12. Fitness means reproductive success, not just physical strength or speed.<br><br>13. Populations have variations, not individuals.<br><br>14. Individuals in population share similarities and share common ancestors.<br><br>15. These ancestors were present at different time in past.<br><br>16. There existed variations in past and these variations got inherited and amplified.<br><br>17. Geological history of earth closely correlates with biological history of earth.<br><br>18. Common estimate is that earth is 4.5 billion years old.<br><br>19. Earth is not thousand years as was thought earlier but billions of years old.<br><br>20. Evidence that evolution of life forms has indeed taken place on earth has come from many quarters.<br><br>21. Fossils are remains of hard parts of life-forms found in rocks.<br><br>22. Rocks form sediments.<br><br>23. Cross-section of earth's crust indicates arrangement of sediments one over the other during long history of earth.<br><br>24. Different sediments contain fossils of different life forms who probably died during formation of particular sediment.<br><br>25. Study of fossils in different sedimentary layers indicates geological period in which they existed.<br><br>26. Some fossils are of extinct organisms.<br><br>27. Dinosaurs are example of extinct organisms.<br><br>28. Study has shown that life-forms varied over time.<br><br>29. Certain life forms are restricted to certain geological time-spans.<br><br>30. New forms of life have arisen at different times in history of earth.<br><br>31. Earth is very old and organisms that lived in past were different from present ones.<br><br>32. All living organisms have evolved from simpler ancestors.<br><br>33. Process of evolution has occurred gradually over millions of years.<br><br>34. Evolution is shown to have occurred.<br><br>35. Haeckel based observation on certain features during embryonic stage which are not found in adult.<br><br>36. Example is observation of row of vestigial gill slits behind head in human embryo.<br><br>37. Vestigial gill slits in human embryo look similar to fish which have gill slits.<br><br>38. Vestigial gill slits are not found in any other adult vertebrates.<br><br>39. Haeckels proposal was disapproved as embryos never pass through adult stages of other animals.<br><br>40. Evidence from embryology establishes similarities and differences among organisms and those that existed years ago."],

Example is Placental wolf and Tasmanian wolf-marsupial.<br><br>3. Evolution by natural selection in true sense would have started when cellular forms of life with differences in metabolic capability originated on earth.<br><br>4. Essence of Darwinian theory about evolution is natural selection.<br><br>5. Rate of appearance of new forms is linked to life cycle or life span.<br><br>6. Microbes that divide fast have ability to multiply and become millions of individuals within hours.<br><br>7. Colony of bacteria growing on given medium has built-in variation in terms of ability to utilise feed component.<br><br>8. Change in medium composition brings to light only that part of population that can survive under new conditions.<br><br>9. Variant bacterial population outgrows others and appears as new species within days.<br><br>10. In fish or fowl evolution would take million years as life span of these animals is in years.<br><br>11. Fitness is based on inherited characteristics.<br><br>12. Nature selects for fitness.<br><br>13. Fitness is based on certain criteria.<br><br>14. Some organisms are better adapted to survive in otherwise hostile environment.<br><br>15. Adaptive ability is inherited.<br><br>16. Adaptive ability has genetic basis.<br><br>17. Fitness is end result of ability to adapt and get selected by nature.<br><br>18. Branching descent and natural selection are two key concepts of Darwinian Theory of Evolution.<br><br>19. French naturalist Lamarck said evolution of life forms had occurred but driven by use and disuse of organs.<br><br>20. Lamarck gave example of Giraffes who in attempt to forage leaves on tall trees had to adapt by elongation of their necks.<br><br>21. Giraffes passed on acquired character of elongated neck to succeeding generations.<br><br>22. Nobody believed that acquired traits were inherited.<br><br>23. Lamarck was proved wrong.<br><br>24. Lamarck said evolution is result of environmental effects on living organisms.<br><br>25. Lamarck said new characteristics once acquired are inherited.<br><br>26. There was no evidence to suggest that acquired characteristics are in fact inherited.<br><br>27. Only correct part of Lamarcks theory was that organisms and their environment interact and this interaction brings about changes in organisms. "],

Health is defined as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being.<br><br>4. When people are healthy, they are more efficient at work.<br><br>5. Health increases productivity and brings economic prosperity.<br><br>6. Health increases longevity of people.<br><br>7. Health reduces infant and maternal mortality.<br><br>8. Balanced diet is important to maintain good health.<br><br>9. Personal hygiene is important to maintain good health.<br><br>10. Regular exercise is important to maintain good health.<br><br>11. Yoga has been practised since time immemorial to achieve mental and physical health.<br><br>12. Awareness about diseases is necessary for achieving good health.<br><br>13. Proper disposal of wastes is necessary for achieving good health.<br><br>14. Control of vectors is necessary for achieving good health.<br><br>15. Maintenance of hygiene in food and water resources is necessary for good health.<br><br>16. When functioning of one or more organs or systems is adversely affected, we have a disease.<br><br>17. Disease is characterised by various signs and symptoms.<br><br>18. Diseases can be broadly grouped into infectious or communicable diseases and non-infectious diseases.<br><br>19. Diseases which are easily transmitted from one person to another are called infectious diseases.<br><br>20. Common examples of infectious diseases include cholera, chickenpox, and tuberculosis.<br><br>21. AIDS is a fatal disease and till date is incurable.<br><br>22. Some infectious diseases like AIDS are fatal if not treated well.<br><br>23. Diseases which are not transmitted from one person to another are called non-infectious diseases.<br><br>24. Examples of non-infectious diseases include cancer and diabetes.<br><br>25. A wide range of organisms can cause diseases in man including bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoans, and helminths.<br><br>26. Disease-causing organisms are called pathogens.<br><br>27. Most parasites are pathogens as they cause harm to the host.<br><br>28. Pathogens can enter a healthy body by various means.<br><br>29. Pathogens multiply or reproduce in our body.<br><br>30. Pathogens interfere with normal vital activities resulting in morphological and functional damage.<br><br>31. Pathogens have to adapt to life in the environment of the host.<br><br>32. Pathogens that enter the gut must survive in the stomach at low pH.<br><br>33. Pathogens that enter the gut must resist various digestive enzymes.<br><br>34. Salmonella typhi is a pathogenic bacterium.<br><br>35. Salmonella typhi causes typhoid fever in human beings.<br><br>36. Salmonella typhi enters the small intestine through food and water contaminated with them.<br><br>37. Salmonella typhi migrates to other organs through blood.<br><br>38. Common symptoms of typhoid fever include sustained high fever ranging from 39 degree to 40 degree C.<br><br>39. Typhoid fever symptoms include weakness, stomach pain, constipation, headache and loss of appetite.<br><br>40. Intestinal perforation and death may occur in severe cases of typhoid fever."],

Sporozoites enter through bite of infected female Anopheles mosquito.<br><br>33. Plasmodium parasites initially multiply within liver cells.<br><br>34. After liver cells, Plasmodium parasites attack red blood cells or RBCs.<br><br>35. Plasmodium infection results in rupture of RBCs.<br><br>36. Rupture of RBCs is associated with release of toxic substance haemozoin.<br><br>37. Haemozoin is responsible for chill and high fever.<br><br>38. Fever in malaria recurs every three to four days.<br><br>39. When female Anopheles mosquito bites infected person, parasites enter mosquito body.<br><br>40.

For diseases like malaria and filariasis transmitted through insect vectors, controlling vectors is most important.<br><br>3. Vector control can be achieved by avoiding stagnation of water in and around residential areas.<br><br>4. Regular cleaning of household coolers helps in vector control.<br><br>5. Use of mosquito nets prevents mosquito-borne disease transmission.<br><br>6. Fishes like Gambusia feed on mosquito larvae and can be introduced in ponds for vector control.<br><br>7. Spraying of insecticides in ditches, drainage areas and swamps helps control vectors.<br><br>8. Doors and windows should be provided with wire mesh to prevent entry of mosquitoes.<br><br>9. Recent widespread infectious diseases in India include H5N1 or bird flu.<br><br>10. Mosquito-borne diseases in India include dengue and chikungunya.<br><br>11. Use of vaccines and immunization programmes have enabled complete eradication of smallpox.<br><br>12. Smallpox is a deadly disease that has been completely eradicated.<br><br>13. Infectious diseases like polio, diphtheria, pneumonia and tetanus have been controlled to large extent by vaccines.<br><br>14. Biotechnology is at the verge of making available newer and safer vaccines.<br><br>15. Discovery of antibiotics has enabled effective treatment of many infectious diseases.<br><br>16. Everyday we are exposed to large number of infectious agents.<br><br>17. Only a few exposures to infectious agents result in disease.<br><br>18. The body is able to defend itself against most pathogens.<br><br>19. The overall ability of the host to fight disease-causing organisms is called immunity.<br><br>20. Immunity is conferred by the immune system.<br><br>21. Immunity is of two types: innate immunity and acquired immunity.<br><br>22. Innate immunity is non-specific type of defence.<br><br>23. Innate immunity is present at the time of birth.<br><br>24. Innate immunity is accomplished by providing different types of barriers to entry of foreign agents.<br><br>25.

In last twenty-five years AIDS has spread all over the world.<br><br>27. AIDS has killed more than 25 million persons.<br><br>28. AIDS is caused by Human Immuno-deficiency Virus or HIV.<br><br>29. HIV is a member of a group of viruses called retrovirus.<br><br>30. Retroviruses have an envelope enclosing RNA genome.<br><br>31. Transmission of HIV-infection occurs by sexual contact with infected person.<br><br>32. HIV transmission occurs by transfusion of contaminated blood and blood products.<br><br>33. HIV transmission occurs by sharing infected needles as in case of intravenous drug abusers.<br><br>34. HIV transmission occurs from infected mother to child through placenta.<br><br>35. People at high risk are persons with multiple sexual partners.<br><br>36. Drug addicts who take drugs intravenously are at high risk for HIV.<br><br>37.

Mechanisms underlying cancer development and its treatment are intense research areas in biology and medicine.<br><br>4. In our body, cell growth and differentiation is highly controlled and regulated.<br><br>5. In cancer cells, there is breakdown of regulatory mechanisms.<br><br>6. Normal cells show property called contact inhibition.<br><br>7. Contact inhibition means contact with other cells inhibits their uncontrolled growth.<br><br>8. Cancer cells appear to have lost property of contact inhibition.<br><br>9. As result of lost contact inhibition, cancerous cells continue to divide.<br><br>10. Continued division of cancerous cells gives rise to masses called tumors.<br><br>11. Tumors are of two types: benign and malignant.<br><br>12. Benign tumors remain confined to their original location.<br><br>13. Benign tumors do not spread to other parts of body and cause little damage.<br><br>14. Malignant tumors are mass of proliferating cells called neoplastic or tumor cells.<br><br>15. Malignant tumor cells grow very rapidly invading and damaging surrounding normal tissues.<br><br>16. Cancer cells actively divide and starve normal cells by competing for vital nutrients.<br><br>17. Cells sloughed from tumors reach distant sites through blood.<br><br>18. When cancer cells get lodged in body, they start new tumor there.<br><br>19. Property of cancer cells spreading to distant sites is called metastasis.<br><br>20. Metastasis is most feared property of malignant tumors.<br><br>21. Transformation of normal cells into cancerous cells may be induced by physical, chemical or biological agents.<br><br>22. Cancer-inducing agents are called carcinogens.<br><br>23. Ionising radiations like X-rays and gamma rays cause DNA damage leading to neoplastic transformation.<br><br>24. Non-ionizing radiations like UV cause DNA damage leading to neoplastic transformation.<br><br>25. Chemical carcinogens present in tobacco smoke are major cause of lung cancer.<br><br>26. Cancer causing viruses are called oncogenic viruses.<br><br>27. Oncogenic viruses have genes called viral oncogenes.<br><br>28. Several genes called cellular oncogenes or c-onc have been identified in normal cells.<br><br>29. Proto oncogenes are genes in normal cells which when activated could lead to oncogenic transformation.<br><br>30. Early detection of cancers is essential as it allows disease to be treated successfully.<br><br>31. Cancer detection is based on biopsy and histopathological studies of tissue.<br><br>32.

In biopsy, thin tissue sections are stained and examined under microscope by pathologist.<br><br>35. Examination of stained tissue sections under microscope is histopathological studies.<br><br>36. Radiography uses X-rays to detect cancers of internal organs.<br><br>37. CT or computed tomography uses X-rays to generate three-dimensional image of internals.<br><br>38.

Sewage treatment is carried out in two stages: primary treatment and secondary treatment.<br><br>3. Primary treatment steps basically involve physical removal of particles from sewage.<br><br>4. Physical removal in primary treatment includes filtration and sedimentation.<br><br>5. Particles are removed in stages during primary treatment - large and small particles.<br><br>6. Initially, floating debris is removed by sequential filtration.<br><br>7. Grit consisting of soil and small pebbles are removed by sedimentation.<br><br>8. All solids that settle during primary treatment form the primary sludge.<br><br>9. The supernatant after primary treatment forms the effluent.<br><br>10. The effluent from the primary settling tank is taken for secondary treatment.<br><br>11. Secondary treatment is also called biological treatment.<br><br>12. The primary effluent is passed into large aeration tanks during secondary treatment.<br><br>13. In aeration tanks, effluent is constantly agitated mechanically.<br><br>14. Air is pumped into the aeration tanks during secondary treatment.<br><br>15. Mechanical agitation and air pumping allow vigorous growth of useful aerobic microbes.<br><br>16. Aerobic microbes grow into flocs during secondary treatment.<br><br>17. Flocs are masses of bacteria associated with fungal filaments to form mesh like structures.<br><br>18. While growing, these microbes consume the major part of organic matter in the effluent.<br><br>19. Microbial growth significantly reduces the BOD of the effluent.<br><br>20. BOD stands for biochemical oxygen demand.<br><br>21. BOD refers to the amount of oxygen that would be consumed if all organic matter in one liter of water were oxidised by bacteria.<br><br>22. Sewage water is treated till the BOD is reduced.<br><br>23. The BOD test measures the rate of uptake of oxygen by micro-organisms in a sample of water.<br><br>24. Indirectly, BOD is a measure of the organic matter present in the water.<br><br>25. The greater the BOD of waste water, more is its polluting potential.<br><br>26. Once BOD is reduced significantly, effluent is passed into a settling tank.<br><br>27. In the settling tank, bacterial flocs are allowed to sediment.<br><br>28. The sediment formed in settling tank is called activated sludge.<br><br>29. A small part of the activated sludge is pumped back into the aeration tank.<br><br>30. The small part of activated sludge pumped back serves as the inoculum.<br><br>31. The remaining major part of the sludge is pumped into large tanks called anaerobic sludge digesters.<br><br>32. In anaerobic sludge digesters, bacteria that grow anaerobically digest the bacteria and fungi in the sludge.<br><br>33. During anaerobic digestion, bacteria produce a mixture of gases.<br><br>34. The gases produced include methane, hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide.<br><br>35. These gases form biogas.<br><br>36. Biogas can be used as source of energy as it is inflammable.<br><br>37.

Restriction enzymes belong to a larger class of enzymes called nucleases that cut nucleic acids.<br><br>3. Nucleases are of two kinds: exonucleases and endonucleases, differing in their site of action on DNA.<br><br>4. Exonucleases remove nucleotides from the ends of the DNA molecule one at a time.<br><br>5. Endonucleases make cuts at specific positions within the DNA molecule at internal sites.<br><br>6. Each restriction endonuclease functions by inspecting the length of a DNA sequence to find its recognition site.<br><br>7. Once restriction enzyme finds its specific recognition sequence, it binds to DNA and cuts each of the two strands of the double helix.<br><br>8. Restriction enzymes cut at specific points in the sugar-phosphate backbones of the two DNA strands.<br><br>9. Each restriction enzyme recognises a specific palindromic nucleotide sequence in the DNA molecule.<br><br>10. Figure 9.1 shows steps in formation of recombinant DNA by action of restriction endonuclease enzyme EcoRI.<br><br>11. EcoRI recognizes and cuts between G and A bases only when the sequence GAATTC is present in the DNA.<br><br>12. When EcoRI cuts DNA, sticky ends are formed due to staggered cuts in the two strands.<br><br>13. DNA fragments with sticky ends can join together at their complementary overhanging ends to form recombinant DNA.<br><br>14. Palindromes are groups of letters that form the same words when read both forward and backward, like MALAYALAM.<br><br>15. In DNA, a palindromic sequence is a sequence of base pairs that reads same on the two strands when orientation is considered.<br><br>16. For example, 5-GAATTC-3 on one strand paired with 3-CTTAAG-5 on complementary strand forms a palindromic sequence.<br><br>17. EcoRI produces sticky ends when it cuts DNA, not blunt ends, making it useful for recombinant DNA technology.<br><br>18. A restriction endonuclease cuts both strands of foreign DNA as well as vector DNA at specific palindromic sequences.<br><br>19. Different restriction enzymes produce different types of ends - some produce sticky ends (like EcoRI, BamHI) while others produce blunt ends (like EcoRV, SmaI).<br><br>20.

  }], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. The following are the features that are required to facilitate cloning into a vector: origin of replication, selectable marker, and cloning sites.<br><br>2. Origin of replication (ori) is a sequence from where replication starts in the vector DNA molecule.<br><br>3. Any piece of DNA when linked to ori sequence can be made to replicate within the host cells through the vector.<br><br>4. The ori sequence is also responsible for controlling the copy number of the linked DNA in the host cell.<br><br>5. If one wants to recover many copies of the target DNA, it should be cloned in a vector whose origin supports high copy number.<br><br>6. In addition to ori, the vector requires a selectable marker which helps in identifying and eliminating non-transformants.<br><br>7. Selectable marker also helps in selectively permitting the growth of the transformants containing the recombinant DNA.<br><br>8. Transformation is a procedure through which a piece of DNA is introduced in a host bacterium for cloning purposes.<br><br>9. Genes encoding resistance to antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline or kanamycin are considered useful selectable markers for E. coli.<br><br>10. The normal E. coli cells do not carry resistance against any of these antibiotics, making them suitable for selection.<br><br>11. For cloning sites, the vector needs to have very few, preferably single, recognition sites for the commonly used restriction enzymes.<br><br>12. Presence of more than one recognition sites within the vector will generate several fragments, which will complicate the gene cloning process.<br><br>13. The ligation of alien DNA is carried out at a restriction site present in one of the two antibiotic resistance genes in the vector.<br><br>14. For example, foreign DNA can be ligated at the BamH I site of tetracycline resistance gene in the vector pBR322.<br><br>15. pBR322 is a modified bacterial plasmid frequently used as a vector for cloning genes in E. coli host cells.<br><br>16. In pBR322, P stands for plasmid, B and R are the names of scientists Boliver and Rodriguez, and 322 is a distinguishing number.<br><br>17. The recombinant plasmids will lose tetracycline resistance due to insertion of foreign DNA at BamH I site in the tet gene.<br><br>18. Recombinant plasmids can still be selected out from non-recombinants by plating transformants on ampicillin containing medium.<br><br>19. Transformants growing on ampicillin medium are then transferred to medium containing tetracycline to distinguish recombinants from non-recombinants.<br><br>20. Non-recombinants will grow on medium containing both antibiotics, while recombinants will only grow on ampicillin medium.<br><br>21. In this selection process, one antibiotic resistance gene helps in selecting transformants while the other helps in identifying recombinants.<br><br>22. Figure 9.4 shows E. coli cloning vector pBR322 with restriction sites (Hind III, EcoR I, BamH I, Sal I, Pvu II, Pst I, Cla I), ori and antibiotic resistance genes.<br><br>23.

Colorless or white colonies are identified as recombinant colonies due to insertional inactivation of beta-galactosidase gene.<br><br>5. Blue colonies indicate non-recombinant bacteria where the beta-galactosidase gene remains functional and produces blue color.<br><br>6. Selection of recombinants due to inactivation of antibiotics is a cumbersome procedure requiring simultaneous plating on two different antibiotic plates.<br><br>7. Alternative selectable markers have been developed which differentiate recombinants from non-recombinants based on color production with chromogenic substrate.<br><br>8. In alternative selection method, recombinant DNA is inserted within the coding sequence of an enzyme beta-galactosidase causing its inactivation.<br><br>9. Insertional inactivation refers to inactivation of gene for synthesis of beta-galactosidase enzyme when foreign DNA is inserted into it.<br><br>10. The lacZ gene encodes the enzyme beta-galactosidase used in blue-white screening for selection of recombinants.<br><br>11. Vectors for cloning genes in plants and animals have been developed by learning from bacteria and viruses that naturally transfer genes.<br><br>12. Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a pathogen of several dicot plants able to deliver a piece of DNA known as T-DNA to transform normal plant cells.<br><br>13. The T-DNA from Agrobacterium tumefaciens can transform normal plant cells into tumor cells that produce chemicals required by the pathogen.<br><br>14. The Ti (Tumor inducing) plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens stands for tumor inducing plasmid found in this soil bacterium.<br><br>15. The Ti plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens has been modified into a cloning vector which is no more pathogenic to plants.<br><br>16. The modified Ti plasmid is still able to use mechanisms to deliver genes of interest into a variety of plants for genetic engineering.<br><br>17. Retroviruses in animals have the ability to transform normal cells into cancerous cells through gene delivery mechanisms.<br><br>18. Retroviruses have been disarmed and are now used to deliver desirable genes into animal cells for gene therapy and research.<br><br>19. Section 9.2.3 introduces Competent Host for transformation with recombinant DNA as an essential requirement for gene transfer.<br><br>20. DNA is a hydrophilic molecule that cannot pass through cell membranes on its own due to its chemical properties.<br><br>21. Bacterial cells must first be made competent to take up DNA by treating them with specific chemicals before transformation.<br><br>22. Bacterial cells are made competent by treating them with a specific concentration of a divalent cation, such as calcium.<br><br>23. Calcium ions increase the efficiency with which DNA enters the bacterium by affecting cell membrane permeability during transformation."],

After ice incubation, cells are placed briefly at 42 degree C (heat shock) and then put back on ice to enable bacteria to take up recombinant DNA.<br><br>3. The correct sequence of making cells competent is: treatment with divalent cations then incubation with rDNA on ice then heat shock at 42 degree C then placed on ice.<br><br>4. Heat shock at 42 degree C for brief period increases cell membrane permeability, facilitating DNA uptake by competent bacterial cells.<br><br>5. Micro-injection is a method where recombinant DNA is directly injected into the nucleus of an animal cell using fine glass pipette.<br><br>6. Biolistics or gene gun is a method suitable for plants where cells are bombarded with high velocity micro-particles of gold or tungsten coated with DNA.<br><br>7. Normally, microinjection is used to transform animal cells and biolistics (gene gun) is used to transform plant cells.<br><br>8. In gene gun method, microparticles of tungsten or gold metal are used to introduce alien DNA into host cells.<br><br>9. Disarmed pathogen vectors can be used to transfer recombinant DNA into host cells when allowed to infect the cell.<br><br>10. Section 9.3 introduces Processes of Recombinant DNA Technology involving several steps in specific sequence.<br><br>11. The steps of recombinant DNA technology include: isolation of DNA, fragmentation by restriction endonucleases, isolation of desired DNA fragment, ligation into vector, transferring to host, culturing, and extraction of desired product.<br><br>12. Section 9.3.1 covers Isolation of the Genetic Material (DNA) as the first step in recombinant DNA technology.<br><br>13. Nucleic acid is the genetic material of all organisms without exception, mostly in the form of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).<br><br>14. DNA needs to be in pure form, free from other macro-molecules before it can be cut with restriction enzymes.<br><br>15. To release DNA, cells must be broken open using specific enzymes: lysozyme for bacteria, cellulase for plant cells, and chitinase for fungus.<br><br>16. Lysozyme enzyme is commonly used to break open bacterial cells to release DNA during isolation process.<br><br>17. Cellulase enzyme is used to treat plant cells during DNA purification to break down the cellulose cell wall.<br><br>18. Chitinase is the first enzyme to be used when extracting DNA from fungal cells to break down chitin in cell walls.<br><br>19. RNA can be removed by treatment with ribonuclease enzyme during DNA purification process.<br><br>20. Proteins can be removed by treatment with protease enzyme to obtain pure DNA from cellular extracts.<br><br>21. Purified DNA ultimately precipitates out after the addition of chilled ethanol to the purified DNA solution.<br><br>22. Figure 9.5 shows DNA that has been separated out can be removed by spooling as collection of fine threads in suspension.<br><br>23.

Restriction enzyme digestions are performed by incubating purified DNA molecule with the restriction enzyme at optimum conditions for that specific enzyme.<br><br>3. Agarose gel electrophoresis is employed to check the progression of a restriction enzyme digestion.<br><br>4. DNA is a negatively charged molecule and hence it moves towards the positive electrode (anode) during electrophoresis.<br><br>5. In agarose gel electrophoresis, DNA fragments produced by restriction enzyme digestion will move towards anode with smaller fragments moving farther than larger segments.<br><br>6. The smallest DNA fragment is present near the anode while the largest fragment remains closer to the cathode in gel electrophoresis.<br><br>7. After cutting source DNA and vector DNA with specific restriction enzyme, the cut gene of interest and cut vector with space are mixed with ligase.<br><br>8. Addition of ligase enzyme results in the preparation of recombinant DNA by joining the gene of interest to the vector.<br><br>9. Section 9.3.3 introduces Amplification of Gene of Interest using PCR as an important technique in recombinant DNA technology.<br><br>10. PCR stands for Polymerase Chain Reaction, a technique for amplifying specific DNA sequences in vitro.<br><br>11. In PCR reaction, multiple copies of the gene (or DNA) of interest is synthesized in vitro using two sets of primers.<br><br>12. Primers used in PCR are small chemically synthesized oligonucleotides that are complementary to the regions of DNA to be amplified.<br><br>13.

The correct order of steps in Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is: Denaturation then Annealing then Extension.<br><br>15. Denaturation is the first step of PCR where DNA is heated at high temperature (94-96 degree C) to separate the two strands of double helix.<br><br>16. Annealing is the second step where two sets of primers anneal to each single-stranded template DNA at temperature 40-60 degree C.<br><br>17. Extension is the third step where Taq DNA polymerase synthesizes new DNA strands from the primers at temperature around 72 degree C.<br><br>18.

}  ], " NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Cells in continuous culture system stay in their active log/exponential phase, maintaining constant growth and productivity.<br><br>2. Continuous culture method produces a larger biomass leading to higher yields of desired proteins compared to batch culture.<br><br>3. A distinct advantage of continuous culture over batch culture is higher productivity with continuous production of proteins.<br><br>4. Small volume cultures cannot yield appreciable quantities of products, necessitating the development of large-scale bioreactors.<br><br>5. To produce in large quantities, bioreactors where large volumes (100-1000 litres) of culture can be processed were developed.<br><br>6. Bioreactors can be thought of as vessels in which raw materials are biologically converted into specific products like proteins and enzymes.<br><br>7. Bioreactors use microbial, plant, animal or human cells to convert raw materials into desired biotechnological products.<br><br>8. A bioreactor provides optimal conditions for achieving the desired product by providing optimum growth rate through controlled parameters.<br><br>9. The optimal conditions provided by bioreactor include temperature, pH, substrate, salts, vitamins, and oxygen for cell growth.<br><br>10. The most commonly used bioreactors are of stirring type, shown in Figure 9.7 on this page.<br><br>11. Figure 9.7 shows two types of bioreactors: (a) Simple stirred-tank bioreactor and (b) Sparged stirred tank bioreactor.<br><br>12. A stirred-tank reactor is usually cylindrical or with a curved base to facilitate the mixing of the reactor contents.<br><br>13. The stirrer in bioreactor facilitates even mixing and oxygen availability throughout the bioreactor for all cells.<br><br>14. In simple stirred tank bioreactor, mixing is done solely by stirring without sparging of air bubbles.<br><br>15. In sparged stirred tank bioreactor, sterile air can be bubbled through the reactor to increase oxygen transfer.<br><br>16. Air bubbles in sparged stirred tank bioreactor dramatically increase the oxygen transfer area for aerobic cell growth.<br><br>17. The role of air bubbles sparged into bioreactor tanks is to increase the surface area for oxygen transfer, not to remove foam.<br><br>18. The bioreactor has an agitator system for mixing, an oxygen delivery system for aeration, and a foam control system.<br><br>19. A bioreactor also has a temperature control system, pH control system, and sampling ports for periodic culture withdrawal.<br><br>20. Sampling ports allow small volumes of the culture to be withdrawn periodically for monitoring growth and product formation.<br><br>21. Section 9.3.6 introduces Downstream Processing as post-biosynthetic processing before marketing the finished product.<br><br>22. After completion of the biosynthetic stage, the product has to be subjected through a series of processes before marketing.<br><br>23. Downstream processing includes separation and purification of the desired product from the bioreactor culture.<br><br>24. Downstream processing occurs after the biosynthetic phase when the product has been produced in the bioreactor.<br><br>25. Separation and purification by filtration, centrifugation of desired compound produced in bioreactor is part of downstream processing only.<br><br>26. Expression is not a component of downstream processing; it occurs during the biosynthetic stage in the bioreactor.<br><br>27. Downstream processing components include separation by gel electrophoresis, purification, and preservation of the product. "],

Downstream processing includes both separation and purification of the desired product after biosynthetic stage.<br><br>3. After completion of biosynthetic stage, the product has to be subjected through a series of processes before marketing as finished product.<br><br>4. The product obtained after biosynthetic stage has to be formulated with suitable preservatives before marketing.<br><br>5.

Strict quality control testing for each product is also required to ensure safety, purity, and potency of biotechnology products.<br><br>8. The downstream processing and quality control testing vary from product to product depending on the nature of the product.<br><br>9. Quality control testing is not a part of downstream processing; it is a separate process that follows downstream processing.<br><br>10. Downstream processing does not include quality control, clinical trials, or sampling from bioreactor - it only includes separation and purification.<br><br>11. Quality control testing does not include separation and purification steps; these are part of downstream processing.<br><br>12. Downstream processing typically involves three primary areas: cell interruption, decontamination segments, and cleaning segment.<br><br>13. The steps of downstream processing include: removal of insolubles, product isolation, and purification of products.<br><br>14. Insolubles like cell debris are removed from fermentation broth by centrifugation, filtration, sedimentation, or precipitation.<br><br>15. Product isolation involves elimination of elements differing from properties of desired product, mainly water removal.<br><br>16. Purification of products involves separation of contaminants closely imitating the product in physical and chemical properties.<br><br>17. Operations in purification include size exclusion, affinity, ion exchange, reversed-phase chromatography, and crystallization.<br><br>18. The final step is polishing, which prepares the product for marketing and ensures it meets quality standards.<br><br>19.

Biotechnology is an applied life science dealing with industrial and commercial use of genetically modified organisms including microbes, fungi, plants, and animals.<br><br>2. Three critical research areas of biotechnology include therapeutics (developing drugs and vaccines), diagnostics (disease detection), and genetically modified crops for agriculture.<br><br>3. Biotechnology applications extend to processed food production, waste management, energy production, and downstream processing technologies for product purification.<br><br>4. Three main approaches for increasing food production are agro-chemical based agriculture, organic agriculture, and genetically engineered crop-based agriculture.<br><br>5. Genetically modified crops are produced using recombinant DNA technology to introduce desired traits like pest resistance, drought tolerance, and enhanced nutritional value.<br><br>6. GM crops help reduce reliance on chemical pesticides by incorporating genes for pest resistance, making them more environmentally sustainable.<br><br>7. Agro-chemical based agriculture uses fertilizers and pesticides to increase yield but can be expensive for farmers in developing countries.<br><br>8. Organic agriculture focuses on natural farming methods without synthetic chemicals, promoting environmental sustainability.<br><br>9. Biotechnology in agriculture aims to produce pest-resistant plant varieties, reducing crop losses and increasing yields.<br><br>10. Examples of genetically modified crops include Bt cotton (insect resistant), Golden Rice (Vitamin A enriched), and herbicide-tolerant crops.<br><br>11.

The Green Revolution succeeded in tripling the food supply but was largely due to improved crop varieties and better management practices using agrochemicals.<br><br>2. Agrochemicals like fertilizers and pesticides are expensive and often unaffordable for farmers in developing countries, creating economic challenges.<br><br>3. Traditional breeding techniques failed to keep pace with increasing food demand, leading to development of modern tissue culture techniques in the 1950s.<br><br>4. Tissue culture is the technique of growing whole plants from explants (any part of plant taken out) in test tubes under sterile conditions in special nutrient media.<br><br>5. Totipotency is the capacity of any cell or explant to generate a complete plant, fundamental principle behind tissue culture success.<br><br>6. Micropropagation is the method of producing thousands of plants in very short durations through tissue culture, enabling rapid plant multiplication.<br><br>7. The nutrient medium for tissue culture must provide a carbon source (sucrose) along with inorganic salts, vitamins, amino acids and growth regulators like auxins and cytokinins.<br><br>8. Advantages of micropropagation include propagation of large numbers of plants in short time periods, independent of seasons.<br><br>9. Plants produced through micropropagation are genetically identical to the original plant, creating somaclones.<br><br>10. Food plants like tomato, banana, and apple have been successfully produced on commercial scale using micropropagation methods.<br><br>11. Tissue culture can be used to recover healthy plants from diseased ones, even those infected with viruses or systemic pathogens.<br><br>12. Meristem culture is the best method to obtain virus-free plants by growing meristem tissue in vitro to obtain pathogen-free plants.<br><br>13. Scientists have successfully cultured meristems of banana, sugarcane, and potato to obtain virus-free plants for commercial production.<br><br>14. Protoplasts are plant cells without cell walls, obtained by enzymatic digestion of cell walls, and can be isolated as single cells.<br><br>15. Isolated protoplasts from two different plant varieties (each having desirable characteristics) can be fused to create hybrid protoplasts.<br><br>16. Somatic hybrids are new plants developed from hybrid protoplasts, and the process is called somatic hybridization.<br><br>17. Hybrid protoplasts surrounded by plasma membranes can be further grown to form a new plant through somatic hybridization technique. "],

Bacillus thuringiensis is a bacterium that produces insecticidal proteins effective against lepidopterans (tobacco budworm, armyworm), coleopterans (beetles), and dipterans (flies, mosquitoes).<br><br>10. B. thuringiensis forms protein crystals during a particular phase of growth containing toxic insecticidal proteins.<br><br>11. The crystals in B. thuringiensis contain insecticidal protein that exists as inactive protoxins within the bacterium, preventing self-toxicity.<br><br>12. The Bt toxin protein does not kill the bacterium itself because it exists in an inactive form (protoxin) inside bacterial cells.<br><br>13. When insects ingest the Bt toxin, the alkaline pH of their gut converts the inactive protoxin into its active form.<br><br>14. The activated Bt toxin binds to the surface of midgut epithelial cells in insects, creating pores in the cell membrane.<br><br>15.

The choice of Bt genes depends upon the crop and the targeted pest, as most Bt toxins are insect group specific, not non-specific.<br><br>3. The Bt toxin is coded by a gene named cry, with several variants including cryIAc, cryIIAb, and cryIAb for different pest targets.<br><br>4. The proteins encoded by the genes cryIAc and cryIIAb control cotton bollworms, providing resistance to this major cotton pest.<br><br>5.

A novel strategy based on RNA interference (RNAi) was adopted to prevent nematode infestation in tobacco plants.<br><br>10. RNAi takes place in all eukaryotic organisms as a method of cellular defense against foreign genetic material.<br><br>11. RNA interference involves silencing of a specific mRNA due to a complementary double stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecule.<br><br>12. The dsRNA molecule binds to and prevents translation of the mRNA, effectively silencing the target gene expression.<br><br>13. Nematode-specific genes were introduced into tobacco plants using Agrobacterium vectors as shown in Figure 10.2.<br><br>14. The introduction of DNA produces both sense and antisense RNA in the host plant cells simultaneously.<br><br>15. These two RNAs being complementary to each other form a double stranded RNA (dsRNA) that initiates RNAi process.<br><br>16. The consequence of RNAi is that the parasite could not survive in a transgenic host expressing specific interfering RNA.<br><br>17. The host plant gets itself protected from the parasite through the RNAi mechanism, providing natural pest resistance.<br><br>18. This method involves silencing nematode genes essential for survival, preventing the nematode from completing its life cycle in the host plant."],

In mammals including humans, insulin is synthesized as a pro-hormone (like a pro-enzyme) which needs to be processed before becoming fully mature and functional.<br><br>3. The pro-hormone proinsulin contains an extra stretch called the C peptide that is not present in mature insulin.<br><br>4. The C peptide is removed during maturation of proinsulin into insulin, resulting in the final functional insulin molecule.<br><br>5. The main challenge for producing insulin using rDNA techniques in 1983 was getting insulin assembled into a mature form.<br><br>6. Eli Lilly company in 1983 prepared two DNA sequences corresponding to A and B chains of human insulin and introduced them into plasmids of E. coli.<br><br>7. Chains A and B of insulin were produced separately in E. coli, extracted, and combined by creating disulphide bonds to form human insulin.<br><br>8. Section 10.2.2 on Gene Therapy discusses treatment of hereditary diseases through genetic correction methods.<br><br>9. Gene therapy is a collection of methods that allows correction of a gene defect diagnosed in a child or embryo.<br><br>10. Correction of genetic defect involves delivery of a normal gene into the individual or embryo to compensate for the non-functional gene.<br><br>11. The first clinical gene therapy was given in 1990 to a 4-year-old girl with adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency.<br><br>12. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) enzyme is crucial for the immune system to function properly.<br><br>13. In some children, ADA deficiency can be treated by bone marrow transplantation or enzyme replacement therapy where functional ADA is given by injection.<br><br>14. Bone marrow transplantation and enzyme replacement therapy approaches are not completely curative for ADA deficiency.<br><br>15. As an alternate approach, lymphocytes from the patient's blood are grown in culture outside the body for gene therapy treatment.<br><br>16. A functional ADA cDNA using a retroviral vector is introduced into these cultured lymphocytes, which are then returned to the patient.<br><br>17. As these genetically engineered lymphocytes are not immortal, the patient requires periodic infusion of such cells.<br><br>18. If the gene isolated from bone marrow cells is introduced into cells at early embryonic stages, it could provide a permanent cure for ADA deficiency.<br><br>19.

The Indian Government has set up GEAC (Genetic Engineering Approval Committee) to make decisions regarding validity of GM research.<br><br>20. GEAC makes decisions regarding the safety of introducing GM organisms for public services like food and medicine sources.<br><br>21. The modification and usage of living organisms for public services has raised problems with patents granted for biological resources.<br><br>22. There is growing public anger that companies are granted patents for products using genetic materials developed by farmers and indigenous people. "],

There are an estimated 200,000 varieties of rice in India alone, making India's diversity one of the richest in the world.<br><br>3. Basmati rice is distinct for its unique aroma and flavour, with 27 documented varieties grown in India.<br><br>4. In 1997, an American company got patent rights on Basmati rice through the US Patent and Trademark Office in a classic case of biopiracy.<br><br>5. The 'new' variety of Basmati patented had actually been derived from Indian farmer's varieties that were crossed with semi-dwarf varieties.<br><br>6. The American company claimed this as an invention or novelty despite it being derived from traditional Indian varieties.<br><br>7. The patent on Basmati rice extends to functional equivalents, meaning other people selling Basmati rice could be restricted by the patent.<br><br>8. Several attempts have been made to patent products and processes based on Indian traditional herbal medicines like turmeric and neem.<br><br>9. If not vigilant and do not immediately counter patent applications, other countries may encroach on India's rich biological legacy.<br><br>10. Biopiracy is the term used to refer to the use of bio-resources by multinational companies without proper authorization and without compensatory payment.<br><br>11. Most industrialised nations are rich financially but poor in biodiversity and traditional knowledge resources.<br><br>12. In contrast, the developing and underdeveloped world is rich in biodiversity and traditional knowledge related to bio-resources.<br><br>13. Traditional knowledge related to bio-resources can be exploited to develop modern applications and save time, effort, and expenditure during commercialisation.<br><br>14. There has been growing realisation of injustice, inadequate compensation, and benefit sharing between developed and developing countries.<br><br>15. Some nations are developing laws to prevent unauthorised exploitation of their bio-resources and traditional knowledge.<br><br>16.

Population Definition: A population is a group of individuals of the same species mainly sharing or competing for similar resources, potentially interbreeding and thus constitute a real discrete and identifiable unit.<br><br>2. Population Examples: All cormorants in a wetland, rats in an abandoned dwelling, teakwood trees in a forest tract, bacteria in a culture plate and lotus plants in a pond are examples of populations.<br><br>3. Population Attributes: A population has certain attributes that an individual organism does not possess - birth rates, death rates, sex ratio and age distribution.<br><br>4. Birth Rate Calculation: If in a pond there are 20 lotus plants last year and through reproduction 8 new plants are added, the birth rate or natality is 8 divided by 20 equals 0.4 offspring per lotus per year.<br><br>5. Death Rate Calculation: If 3 plants died during the year out of initial 20, the death rate or mortality is 3 divided by 20 equals 0.15 offspring per lotus per year.<br><br>6. Sex Ratio Definition: An individual may be a male or a female but a population has a sex ratio. Example: 60 percent of population are females and 40 percent males gives ratio 60:40 or 3:2.<br><br>7. Age Distribution: Age composition or age distribution is another attribute of a population referring to the percentage of individuals of different age groups.<br><br>8. Age Pyramid: When percentage of individuals of a given age or age group is plotted for the population, the resulting structure is called the age pyramid.<br><br>9. Age Pyramid Shapes: The shape of the age pyramid reflects the growth status - triangular shape indicates expanding population, bell shape indicates stable population, urn shape indicates declining population.<br><br>10.

Four Factors Affecting Population: Population density is affected by four basic processes - Natality (B), Mortality (D), Immigration (I), and Emigration (E).<br><br>2. Natality Definition: Natality refers to the number of births during a given period in the population that are added to the initial density. It contributes to increase in population density.<br><br>3. Mortality Definition: Mortality is the number of deaths in the population during a given period. It contributes to decrease in population density.<br><br>4. Immigration Definition: Immigration is the number of individuals of the same species that have come into the habitat from elsewhere during the time period under consideration. It increases population density.<br><br>5. Emigration Definition: Emigration is the number of individuals of the population who left the habitat and gone elsewhere during the time period under consideration. It decreases population density.<br><br>6. Population Density Formula: If N is the population density at time t, then its density at time t + 1 is: Nt+1 = Nt + [(B + I) - (D + E)].<br><br>7. Population Increase Condition: Population density will increase if the number of births plus immigrants (B + I) is more than the number of deaths plus emigrants (D + E).<br><br>8. Normal Conditions: Under normal conditions, births and deaths are the most important factors influencing population density. Immigration and Emigration assume importance only under special conditions.<br><br>9. Special Conditions: If a new habitat is just being colonized, immigration may contribute more significantly to population growth than birth rates.<br><br>10.

The population grows in an exponential or geometric fashion.<br><br>2. Darwin's Observation: Darwin observed exponential growth while developing his theory of natural selection, noting that populations have the ability to grow rapidly when resources are unlimited.<br><br>3. Growth Rate Formula: If birth rate per capita is b and death rate per capita is d, then the rate of change in population dN/dt = (b - d) × N.<br><br>4. Simplified Form: Let (b - d) = r, then dN/dt = rN, where r is the intrinsic rate of natural increase.<br><br>5. Intrinsic Rate (r): The r in the equation is called the intrinsic rate of natural increase and is a very important parameter for assessing impacts of any biotic or abiotic factor on population growth.<br><br>6. r Values Examples: For Norway rat, r = 0.015. For human population in 1981, r value was 0.0205. In 1981, what the current r value is for calculating it, you need to know the birth and death rates.<br><br>7. J-shaped Curve: Exponential growth results in a J-shaped curve when population size (N) is plotted against time. This indicates unlimited resources.<br><br>8. Integral Form Equation: Using integral calculus, the exponential growth equation is Nt = N0 e^rt, where Nt is population after time t, N0 is initial population, r is intrinsic rate, and e is base of natural logarithms (2.71828).<br><br>9. Rapid Growth Potential: Any species growing exponentially under unlimited resource conditions can reach enormous population densities in a short time.<br><br>10. Exponential vs Logistic: When resources are not limiting, growth plot is exponential (J-shaped). When resources are limiting, growth is logistic (S-shaped) with carrying capacity K. "],

S-shaped Growth: When resources are limited, population eventually exhibits S-shaped or sigmoid growth curve.<br><br>4.

Asymptote Definition: When the population density reaches the carrying capacity, it reaches asymptote phase. Asymptote is obtained when K equals N.<br><br>6. Verhulst-Pearl Logistic Growth: This type of population growth is called Verhulst-Pearl Logistic Growth and produces a sigmoid curve.<br><br>7. Logistic Growth Equation: The equation is dN/dt = rN[(K-N)/K], where N is population density at time t, r is intrinsic rate of natural increase, and K is carrying capacity.<br><br>8. Carrying Capacity (K): K represents the maximum population size that the environment can sustain indefinitely with available resources.<br><br>9. Growth Limiting Factor: The factor [(K-N)/K] represents the fraction of carrying capacity available for further growth. When N approaches K, this factor approaches zero, slowing growth.<br><br>10. Maximum Growth Rate: In logistic growth, the population growth rate is maximum when N equals K/2, which is the inflection point of the S-shaped curve.<br><br>11.

When experimentally removed, more than 10 species of invertebrates became extinct within a year due to interspecific competition.<br><br>3. Prey Defense - Camouflage: Some species of insects and frogs are cryptically-colored (camouflaged) to avoid being detected easily by predators.<br><br>4. Prey Defense - Poison: Some prey species are poisonous and therefore avoided by predators.<br><br>5. Monarch Butterfly: The monarch butterfly is highly distasteful to its predator (bird) because of a special chemical present in its body. The butterfly acquires this chemical during its caterpillar stage by feeding on a poisonous weed.<br><br>6. Morphological Defence: Thorns (Acacia, Cactus) are the most common morphological means of defence in plants against herbivory.<br><br>7. Chemical Defence in Plants: Many plants produce and store chemicals that make herbivores sick when eaten, inhibit feeding or digestion, disrupt reproduction or even kill them.<br><br>8.

Plant Rewards: Plants offer rewards in the form of pollen and nectar for pollinators and juicy and nutritious fruits for seed dispersers.<br><br>3. Fig-Wasp Relationship: In many species of fig trees, there is a tight one-to-one relationship with the pollinator species of wasp. This is a classic example of coevolution.<br><br>4. Species-Specific Pollination: A given fig species can be pollinated only by its 'partner' wasp species and no other species.<br><br>5. Mutualistic Benefits: The wasp pollinates the fig inflorescence while searching for suitable egg-laying sites.

Ecological Pyramid Definition: The relationship between organisms at different trophic levels is expressed in terms of number, biomass or amount of energy present at successive trophic levels forming ecological pyramids.<br><br>2. Pyramid of Numbers in Grassland: The pyramid of numbers in a grassland ecosystem is always upright because producers (grasses) are maximum in number, followed by primary consumers, secondary consumers and tertiary consumers.<br><br>3. Pyramid of Numbers Inverted: Pyramid of numbers is inverted in case of tree ecosystem or parasitic food chain where few large trees support large number of insects and herbivores.<br><br>4. Pyramid of Biomass Upright: The pyramid of biomass in terrestrial ecosystems like grassland and forest is upright with producers having maximum biomass at the base.<br><br>5. Pyramid of Biomass Inverted: The pyramid of biomass in sea or aquatic ecosystem is generally inverted. This is because the standing crop of phytoplankton (producers) is less than that of zooplankton and fish at any instant.<br><br>6. Phytoplankton Characteristic: Despite low biomass, phytoplankton can support large biomass of consumers because they have high reproductive rates and rapid turnover.<br><br>7. Standing Crop in Pyramids: Each trophic level has a certain mass of living material at a particular time called standing crop which is used to construct pyramid of biomass.<br><br>8. Pyramid of Energy: Pyramid of energy is always upright and can never be inverted because energy decreases at each successive trophic level due to energy loss.<br><br>9. Three Types of Pyramids: Ecological pyramids are of three types - Pyramid of numbers, Pyramid of biomass and Pyramid of energy.<br><br>10.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Pyramid of Energy Always Upright: Pyramid of energy is always upright and can never be inverted because when energy flows from a particular trophic level to the next trophic level, some energy is always lost as heat at each step.<br><br>2. Energy Loss at Each Level: At each trophic level, energy is lost through respiration, metabolic activities, heat dissipation, and other processes. Only about 10% energy is transferred to next level.<br><br>3. Unidirectional Energy Flow: Energy flow in an ecosystem is unidirectional. Energy flows from sun to producers, then to herbivores, then to carnivores and never flows back to sun or previous trophic levels.<br><br>4. Pyramid of Energy Measurement: Pyramid of energy is measured in terms of energy per unit area per time (J/m²/year or kcal/m²/year).<br><br>5. Limitation 1 - Same Species: Ecological pyramids do not take into account the same species belonging to two or more trophic levels. Example: Sparrow can eat both seeds (herbivore) and insects (carnivore).<br><br>6. Limitation 2 - Simple Food Chain: Ecological pyramids assume a simple food chain, something that almost never exists in nature as most ecosystems have complex food webs.<br><br>7. Limitation 3 - No Food Web: Ecological pyramids do not accommodate a food web structure which is the natural reality in ecosystems.<br><br>8. Limitation 4 - Saprophytes Excluded: Saprophytes or decomposers are not given any place in ecological pyramids even though they play a vital role in the ecosystem by recycling nutrients.<br><br>9. Energy Cannot Return: The energy captured by autotrophs never returns back to solar energy. Energy obtained by herbivores never goes back to autotrophs. Hence energy flow is always unidirectional.<br><br>10. Progressive Energy Flow: The energy flow through different trophic levels is progressive and hence previous trophic level cannot get energy back from higher levels."],
