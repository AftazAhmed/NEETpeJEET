Better awareness about sex-related matters, increased medically assisted deliveries, better post-natal care, decreased maternal and infant mortality rates, increased couples with small families, better STD detection and cure, and overall increased medical facilities for reproduction lead to better health of society.<br><br>2. In the last century, all-round development significantly improved quality of life, but increased health facilities and better living conditions had explosive impact on population growth.<br><br>3. World population was around 2 billion in 1900, rocketed to about 6 billion by 2000 and 7.2 billion in 2011.<br><br>4. India population was approximately 350 million at independence, reached close to billion mark by 2000 and crossed 1.2 billion in May 2011.<br><br>5. Rapid decline in death rate, maternal mortality rate (MMR) and infant mortality rate (IMR) as well as increase in number of people in reproductive age are probable reasons for explosive population growth.<br><br>6. Through RCH programme, population growth rate was brought down but only marginally.<br><br>7. According to 2011 census report, population growth rate was less than 2 per cent i.e. 20/1000/year, a rate at which population could increase rapidly.<br><br>8. Alarming population growth rate could lead to absolute scarcity of even basic requirements i.e. food, shelter and clothing.<br><br>9. The most important step to overcome rapid population growth is to motivate smaller families by using various contraceptive methods.<br><br>10. Hum Do Hamare Do (we two, our two) slogan promotes two child norm showing happy couple with two children.<br><br>11. Many young, urban, working couples have adopted one child norm.<br><br>12. Statutory marriageable age of female is 18 years and that of males is 21 years.<br><br>13. Incentives are given to couples who have small families as a measure to control population growth.<br><br>14. An ideal contraceptive should be user-friendly, easily available, effective and reversible with no or least side-effects.<br><br>15. An ideal contraceptive should not interfere with sexual drive, desire or sexual act of the user.<br><br>16. Contraceptive methods are broadly grouped into seven categories namely Natural or Traditional, Barrier, IUDs, Oral contraceptives, Injectables, Implants and Surgical methods."],

Periodic abstinence is a natural method in which couples avoid or abstain from coitus from day 10 to 17 of menstrual cycle when ovulation could be expected.<br><br>3. Period from day 10 to 17 of menstrual cycle is called fertile period as chances of fertilisation are very high during this period.<br><br>4. Withdrawal or coitus interruptus is a method in which male partner withdraws his penis from vagina just before ejaculation to avoid insemination.<br><br>5. Lactational amenorrhea method is based on the fact that ovulation and menstrual cycle do not occur during period of intense lactation following parturition.<br><br>6. Lactational amenorrhea method is effective only upto maximum period of six months following parturition as long as mother breast-feeds child fully.<br><br>7. In all natural methods, side effects are almost nil but chances of failure are high.<br><br>8. In barrier methods, ovum and sperms are prevented from physically meeting with help of barriers.<br><br>9. Barrier methods are available for both males and females.<br><br>10. Condoms are barriers made of thin rubber or latex sheath used to cover penis in male or vagina and cervix in female just before coitus.<br><br>11. Condoms prevent ejaculated semen from entering female reproductive tract and thus prevent conception.<br><br>12. Nirodh is a popular brand of condom for the male.<br><br>13. Use of condoms has increased in recent years due to its additional advantage of protecting user from contracting STIs and AIDS.<br><br>14. Male and female condoms are disposable, can be self inserted and give privacy to the user.<br><br>15. Diaphragms, cervical caps and vaults are barrier methods made of rubber that are inserted into female reproductive tract to cover cervix during coitus.<br><br>16. Diaphragms, cervical caps and vaults prevent conception by blocking entry of sperms through cervix and are reusable.<br><br>17. Spermicidal creams, jellies and foams are available which increase contraceptive efficiency of barrier methods.<br><br>18.

Sterilisation procedure in female is called tubectomy in which fallopian tubes are removed or tied up through small incision in abdomen or through vagina.<br><br>4. Vasectomy and tubectomy are highly effective but their reversibility is very poor.<br><br>5. Selection of suitable contraceptive method and its use should always be undertaken in consultation with qualified medical personnel.<br><br>6.

In an individual only two alleles can be present; multiple alleles can be found only when population studies are made.<br><br>3. A single gene product may occasionally produce more than one effect (pleiotropy).<br><br>4. Starch synthesis in pea seeds is controlled by one gene with two alleles (B and b).<br><br>5. BB homozygotes synthesize starch effectively, producing large starch grains and round seeds.<br><br>6. bb homozygotes have lesser efficiency in starch synthesis, producing smaller starch grains and wrinkled seeds.<br><br>7. Heterozygotes (Bb) produce round seeds with intermediate starch grain size.<br><br>8. If starch grain size is considered as the phenotype, the alleles B and b show incomplete dominance.<br><br>9.

UTRs are required for efficient translation process.<br><br>11. For initiation, ribosome binds to mRNA at the start codon (AUG).<br><br>12. The start codon is recognised only by the initiator tRNA.<br><br>13. During elongation, complexes of amino acid joined to tRNA bind to appropriate codon in mRNA by forming complementary base pairs with tRNA anticodon.<br><br>14. The ribosome moves from codon to codon along the mRNA.<br><br>15. Amino acids are added one by one during translation.<br><br>16. Polypeptide sequences are dictated by DNA and represented by mRNA.<br><br>17. A release factor binds to the stop codon, terminating translation and releasing the complete polypeptide from ribosome.<br><br>18. Regulation of gene expression can occur at various levels like replication, transcription, translation.<br><br>19. In eukaryotes, regulation can be exerted at: (i) Transcriptional level (formation of primary transcript), (ii) Processing level (regulation of splicing), (iii) Transport of mRNA from nucleus to cytoplasm, (iv) Translational level."],

Lighter H2 escaped from early earth atmosphere.<br><br>16. Oxygen combined with ammonia and methane to form water, CO2 and others.<br><br>17. Ozone layer was formed on earth.<br><br>18. As earth cooled, water vapour fell as rain.<br><br>19. Water vapour condensed and rain filled all depressions to form oceans.<br><br>20. Life appeared almost four billion years back.<br><br>21. Early Greek thinkers thought units of life called spores were transferred to different planets including earth.<br><br>22. Spores is the unit, and it was favourite idea for some astronomers.<br><br>23. For long time it was believed that life came from outer space.<br><br>24. Some scientists believe that life came from outside earth.<br><br>25. Theory of life from spores was called theory of spontaneous generation.<br><br>26. Louis Pasteur by careful experimentation demonstrated that life comes only from pre-existing life.<br><br>27. Pasteur showed that in pre-sterilised flasks, life did not come from killed yeast.<br><br>28. In similar flasks open to air, new living organisms arose from dead yeast.<br><br>29.

While microbes cause diseases like tuberculosis, cholera, and typhoid, several microbes are useful to humans in diverse ways.<br><br>2. Microbes or products derived from them are used in everyday life including household products.<br><br>3. A common example of microbial application is production of curd from milk.<br><br>4. Lactobacillus and several other lactic acid bacteria (LAB) grow in milk and convert it to curd.<br><br>5. During growth, LAB produce acids that coagulate and partially digest the milk proteins.<br><br>6. A small amount of curd added to fresh milk as inoculum or starter contains millions of LAB.<br><br>7. At suitable temperature, LAB multiply and convert milk into curd.<br><br>8. Curd improves nutritional quality by increasing vitamin B12 content.<br><br>9. In the stomach, LAB play very beneficial role in checking disease-causing microbes.<br><br>10. Dough used for making bread is fermented using bakers yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.<br><br>11. During fermentation of bread dough, CO2 is produced which gives the puffed-up appearance.<br><br>12. Gas bubbles of CO2 are trapped in dough causing it to rise.<br><br>13. Dough used for making dosa and idli are fermented by bacteria.<br><br>14. The puffed-up appearance of dough is due to production of CO2 gas.<br><br>15. Traditional drinks and foods are made by fermentation using microbes.<br><br>16. Toddy is a traditional drink of some parts of southern India made by fermenting sap from palms.<br><br>17. Cheese is one of the oldest food items in which microbes were used to process and preserve milk.<br><br>18. Cheese is made more nutritious and delicious by microbial action.<br><br>19. Different varieties of cheese are known by their characteristic texture, flavour and taste.<br><br>20. The specificity of cheese characteristics comes from the specific microbes used.<br><br>21. Large holes in Swiss cheese are due to production of large amount of CO2 by bacterium Propionibacterium shermanii.<br><br>22. Roquefort cheese are ripened by growing a specific fungi on them which gives particular flavour.<br><br>23. In industry, microbes are used to synthesize a number of products valuable to human beings.<br><br>24. Beverages and antibiotics are examples of industrial products made using microbes.<br><br>25. Production on an industrial scale requires growing microbes in very large vessels called fermentors.<br><br>26. Figure 8.4 shows fermentors used for industrial production of microbial products. "],

Physical removal in primary treatment includes filtration and sedimentation.<br><br>5. Particles are removed in stages during primary treatment - large and small particles.<br><br>6. Initially, floating debris is removed by sequential filtration.<br><br>7. Grit consisting of soil and small pebbles are removed by sedimentation.<br><br>8. All solids that settle during primary treatment form the primary sludge.<br><br>9. The supernatant after primary treatment forms the effluent.<br><br>10.

Aerobic microbes grow into flocs during secondary treatment.<br><br>17. Flocs are masses of bacteria associated with fungal filaments to form mesh like structures.<br><br>18. While growing, these microbes consume the major part of organic matter in the effluent.<br><br>19. Microbial growth significantly reduces the BOD of the effluent.<br><br>20.

Microbial treatment of sewage has been practiced for more than a century now in almost all parts of the world.<br><br>3. Till date, no man-made technology has been able to rival the microbial treatment of sewage.<br><br>4. Due to increasing urbanisation, sewage is being produced in much larger quantities than ever before.<br><br>5. The number of sewage treatment plants has not increased enough to treat such large quantities of sewage.<br><br>6. Untreated sewage is often discharged directly into rivers leading to their pollution.<br><br>7. Discharge of untreated sewage causes increase in water-borne diseases.<br><br>8. The Ministry of Environment and Forests has initiated Ganga Action Plan to save the Ganga river from pollution.<br><br>9. The Ministry of Environment and Forests has initiated Yamuna Action Plan to save the Yamuna river from pollution.<br><br>10. Under Ganga and Yamuna Action Plans, it is proposed to build large number of sewage treatment plants.<br><br>11. Under these plans, only treated sewage may be discharged in the rivers.<br><br>12. Biogas is a mixture of gases containing predominantly methane.<br><br>13. Biogas is produced by microbial activity and may be used as fuel.<br><br>14. Microbes produce different types of gaseous end-products during growth and metabolism.<br><br>15. The type of gas produced depends upon the microbes and the organic substrates they utilise.<br><br>16. In fermentation of dough, cheese making and beverage production, the main gas produced was CO2.<br><br>17. Certain bacteria grow anaerobically on cellulosic material.<br><br>18. These anaerobic bacteria produce large amount of methane along with CO2 and H2.<br><br>19. Bacteria that produce methane are collectively called methanogens.<br><br>20. Methanobacterium is one such common methanogen.<br><br>21. Methanogens are commonly found in the anaerobic sludge during sewage treatment.<br><br>22. Methanogens are also present in the rumen which is a part of stomach of cattle.<br><br>23. A lot of cellulosic material present in the food of cattle is also present in the rumen.<br><br>24.

The cutting of DNA by restriction endonucleases results in the formation of DNA fragments that need to be separated and isolated.<br><br>3. DNA fragments can be separated by a technique known as gel electrophoresis based on their size differences.<br><br>4. DNA fragments are negatively charged molecules that can be separated by forcing them to move towards the anode under an electric field.<br><br>5. The movement of DNA fragments occurs through a medium or matrix during gel electrophoresis separation process.<br><br>6. The most commonly used matrix for gel electrophoresis is agarose, which is a natural polymer extracted from sea weeds.<br><br>7. Agarose provides a sieving effect that allows DNA fragments to separate according to their size during electrophoresis.<br><br>8. In gel electrophoresis, the smaller the fragment size, the farther it moves towards the anode end of the gel.<br><br>9. Larger DNA fragments move slowly and remain closer to the wells where the DNA sample was initially loaded.<br><br>10. Figure 9.3 shows a typical agarose gel electrophoresis with undigested DNA in lane 1 and digested DNA fragments in lanes 2 to 4.<br><br>11. The separated DNA fragments can be visualized only after staining the DNA with a compound known as ethidium bromide.<br><br>12. After ethidium bromide staining, DNA fragments must be exposed to UV radiation for visualization as they cannot be seen in visible light.<br><br>13. DNA strands stained with ethidium bromide when viewed under UV radiation appear as bright orange colored bands.<br><br>14. The separated coloured bands of DNA are cut out from the agarose gel and extracted from the gel piece in a step known as elution.<br><br>15.

  }], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. The following are the features that are required to facilitate cloning into a vector: origin of replication, selectable marker, and cloning sites.<br><br>2. Origin of replication (ori) is a sequence from where replication starts in the vector DNA molecule.<br><br>3. Any piece of DNA when linked to ori sequence can be made to replicate within the host cells through the vector.<br><br>4. The ori sequence is also responsible for controlling the copy number of the linked DNA in the host cell.<br><br>5. If one wants to recover many copies of the target DNA, it should be cloned in a vector whose origin supports high copy number.<br><br>6. In addition to ori, the vector requires a selectable marker which helps in identifying and eliminating non-transformants.<br><br>7. Selectable marker also helps in selectively permitting the growth of the transformants containing the recombinant DNA.<br><br>8. Transformation is a procedure through which a piece of DNA is introduced in a host bacterium for cloning purposes.<br><br>9. Genes encoding resistance to antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline or kanamycin are considered useful selectable markers for E. coli.<br><br>10. The normal E. coli cells do not carry resistance against any of these antibiotics, making them suitable for selection.<br><br>11. For cloning sites, the vector needs to have very few, preferably single, recognition sites for the commonly used restriction enzymes.<br><br>12. Presence of more than one recognition sites within the vector will generate several fragments, which will complicate the gene cloning process.<br><br>13. The ligation of alien DNA is carried out at a restriction site present in one of the two antibiotic resistance genes in the vector.<br><br>14. For example, foreign DNA can be ligated at the BamH I site of tetracycline resistance gene in the vector pBR322.<br><br>15. pBR322 is a modified bacterial plasmid frequently used as a vector for cloning genes in E. coli host cells.<br><br>16. In pBR322, P stands for plasmid, B and R are the names of scientists Boliver and Rodriguez, and 322 is a distinguishing number.<br><br>17. The recombinant plasmids will lose tetracycline resistance due to insertion of foreign DNA at BamH I site in the tet gene.<br><br>18. Recombinant plasmids can still be selected out from non-recombinants by plating transformants on ampicillin containing medium.<br><br>19. Transformants growing on ampicillin medium are then transferred to medium containing tetracycline to distinguish recombinants from non-recombinants.<br><br>20. Non-recombinants will grow on medium containing both antibiotics, while recombinants will only grow on ampicillin medium.<br><br>21. In this selection process, one antibiotic resistance gene helps in selecting transformants while the other helps in identifying recombinants.<br><br>22. Figure 9.4 shows E. coli cloning vector pBR322 with restriction sites (Hind III, EcoR I, BamH I, Sal I, Pvu II, Pst I, Cla I), ori and antibiotic resistance genes.<br><br>23. The pBR322 vector contains ampR (ampicillin resistance gene) and tetR (tetracycline resistance gene) as selectable markers.<br><br>24.

Restriction enzyme digestions are performed by incubating purified DNA molecule with the restriction enzyme at optimum conditions for that specific enzyme.<br><br>3. Agarose gel electrophoresis is employed to check the progression of a restriction enzyme digestion.<br><br>4. DNA is a negatively charged molecule and hence it moves towards the positive electrode (anode) during electrophoresis.<br><br>5. In agarose gel electrophoresis, DNA fragments produced by restriction enzyme digestion will move towards anode with smaller fragments moving farther than larger segments.<br><br>6. The smallest DNA fragment is present near the anode while the largest fragment remains closer to the cathode in gel electrophoresis.<br><br>7. After cutting source DNA and vector DNA with specific restriction enzyme, the cut gene of interest and cut vector with space are mixed with ligase.<br><br>8. Addition of ligase enzyme results in the preparation of recombinant DNA by joining the gene of interest to the vector.<br><br>9. Section 9.3.3 introduces Amplification of Gene of Interest using PCR as an important technique in recombinant DNA technology.<br><br>10. PCR stands for Polymerase Chain Reaction, a technique for amplifying specific DNA sequences in vitro.<br><br>11. In PCR reaction, multiple copies of the gene (or DNA) of interest is synthesized in vitro using two sets of primers.<br><br>12. Primers used in PCR are small chemically synthesized oligonucleotides that are complementary to the regions of DNA to be amplified.<br><br>13. Figure 9.6 shows Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) with each cycle having three steps: Denaturation, Primer annealing, and Extension.<br><br>14. The correct order of steps in Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is: Denaturation then Annealing then Extension.<br><br>15. Denaturation is the first step of PCR where DNA is heated at high temperature (94-96 degree C) to separate the two strands of double helix.<br><br>16. Annealing is the second step where two sets of primers anneal to each single-stranded template DNA at temperature 40-60 degree C.<br><br>17. Extension is the third step where Taq DNA polymerase synthesizes new DNA strands from the primers at temperature around 72 degree C.<br><br>18. Taq polymerase catalyzes only the extension of primer end on the template DNA, not denaturation or annealing steps in PCR.<br><br>19. The thermostable enzyme Taq polymerase used in PCR technique was isolated from the bacterium Thermus aquaticus.<br><br>20. Taq polymerase is thermostable, meaning it can withstand high temperatures (up to 95 degree C) without denaturing during repeated PCR cycles.<br><br>21. After denaturation step, the mixture needs to cool down to lower temperature (40-60 degree C) to permit specific annealing of the primers.<br><br>22. After 30 cycles of PCR, the target DNA is amplified approximately 1 billion times (2 to the power 30 is approximately 1 billion times).<br><br>23. The three steps of Denaturation, Annealing, and Extension are repeated for about 30 cycles to achieve exponential amplification of target DNA.

If the process of replication of DNA in PCR is repeated many times, the segment of DNA can be amplified to approximately billion times.<br><br>5.

Thermostable DNA polymerase (Taq polymerase) remains active during the high temperature induced denaturation of double stranded DNA in PCR.<br><br>7. Taq polymerase is a thermostable DNA polymerase used in PCR, not inactive at high temperature as it functions at 72 degree C during extension step.<br><br>8. The thermostable enzymes Taq and Pfu isolated from thermophilic bacteria are DNA polymerases used in PCR applications.<br><br>9. The amplified DNA fragment from PCR can be used to ligate with a vector for further cloning as shown in Figure 9.6.<br><br>10. Section 9.3.4 covers Insertion of Recombinant DNA into the Host Cell/Organism with several methods for introducing ligated DNA.<br><br>11. Recipient cells are made competent to receive and take up DNA present in their surrounding environment through transformation.<br><br>12. If recombinant DNA bearing gene for resistance to antibiotic ampicillin is transferred into E. coli cells, the host cells become transformed into ampicillin-resistant cells.<br><br>13. When transformed cells are spread on agar plates containing ampicillin, only transformants will grow while untransformed recipient cells will die.<br><br>14. The ampicillin resistance gene that allows selection of transformed cells in the presence of ampicillin is called a selectable marker.<br><br>15. Useful selectable markers for E. coli include genes for resistance to antibiotics like ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline or kanamycin.<br><br>16. Genes encoding proteins that degrade antibiotics would NOT be useful selectable markers as they would allow all cells to survive.<br><br>17.

Continuous culture method produces a larger biomass leading to higher yields of desired proteins compared to batch culture.<br><br>3. A distinct advantage of continuous culture over batch culture is higher productivity with continuous production of proteins.<br><br>4. Small volume cultures cannot yield appreciable quantities of products, necessitating the development of large-scale bioreactors.<br><br>5. To produce in large quantities, bioreactors where large volumes (100-1000 litres) of culture can be processed were developed.<br><br>6. Bioreactors can be thought of as vessels in which raw materials are biologically converted into specific products like proteins and enzymes.<br><br>7. Bioreactors use microbial, plant, animal or human cells to convert raw materials into desired biotechnological products.<br><br>8. A bioreactor provides optimal conditions for achieving the desired product by providing optimum growth rate through controlled parameters.<br><br>9. The optimal conditions provided by bioreactor include temperature, pH, substrate, salts, vitamins, and oxygen for cell growth.<br><br>10. The most commonly used bioreactors are of stirring type, shown in Figure 9.7 on this page.<br><br>11. Figure 9.7 shows two types of bioreactors: (a) Simple stirred-tank bioreactor and (b) Sparged stirred tank bioreactor.<br><br>12. A stirred-tank reactor is usually cylindrical or with a curved base to facilitate the mixing of the reactor contents.<br><br>13. The stirrer in bioreactor facilitates even mixing and oxygen availability throughout the bioreactor for all cells.<br><br>14. In simple stirred tank bioreactor, mixing is done solely by stirring without sparging of air bubbles.<br><br>15. In sparged stirred tank bioreactor, sterile air can be bubbled through the reactor to increase oxygen transfer.<br><br>16. Air bubbles in sparged stirred tank bioreactor dramatically increase the oxygen transfer area for aerobic cell growth.<br><br>17. The role of air bubbles sparged into bioreactor tanks is to increase the surface area for oxygen transfer, not to remove foam.<br><br>18. The bioreactor has an agitator system for mixing, an oxygen delivery system for aeration, and a foam control system.<br><br>19. A bioreactor also has a temperature control system, pH control system, and sampling ports for periodic culture withdrawal.<br><br>20. Sampling ports allow small volumes of the culture to be withdrawn periodically for monitoring growth and product formation.<br><br>21.

Biotechnology applications extend to processed food production, waste management, energy production, and downstream processing technologies for product purification.<br><br>4. Three main approaches for increasing food production are agro-chemical based agriculture, organic agriculture, and genetically engineered crop-based agriculture.<br><br>5. Genetically modified crops are produced using recombinant DNA technology to introduce desired traits like pest resistance, drought tolerance, and enhanced nutritional value.<br><br>6. GM crops help reduce reliance on chemical pesticides by incorporating genes for pest resistance, making them more environmentally sustainable.<br><br>7. Agro-chemical based agriculture uses fertilizers and pesticides to increase yield but can be expensive for farmers in developing countries.<br><br>8. Organic agriculture focuses on natural farming methods without synthetic chemicals, promoting environmental sustainability.<br><br>9. Biotechnology in agriculture aims to produce pest-resistant plant varieties, reducing crop losses and increasing yields.<br><br>10. Examples of genetically modified crops include Bt cotton (insect resistant), Golden Rice (Vitamin A enriched), and herbicide-tolerant crops.<br><br>11. The Green Revolution succeeded in tripling food supply through improved crop varieties and better management practices.<br><br>12. Therapeutics involves development of medicines, vaccines, and treatment methods using biotechnology.<br><br>13. Diagnostics uses biotechnology for early disease detection through techniques like PCR, ELISA, and recombinant DNA technology.<br><br>14. Downstream processing in biotechnology involves separation, purification, and quality control of biosynthetic products before marketing.<br><br>15. Genetically engineered crops offer solutions to minimize fertilizer and chemical use while maximizing yields from agricultural fields."],

The Green Revolution succeeded in tripling the food supply but was largely due to improved crop varieties and better management practices using agrochemicals.<br><br>2. Agrochemicals like fertilizers and pesticides are expensive and often unaffordable for farmers in developing countries, creating economic challenges.<br><br>3. Traditional breeding techniques failed to keep pace with increasing food demand, leading to development of modern tissue culture techniques in the 1950s.<br><br>4. Tissue culture is the technique of growing whole plants from explants (any part of plant taken out) in test tubes under sterile conditions in special nutrient media.<br><br>5. Totipotency is the capacity of any cell or explant to generate a complete plant, fundamental principle behind tissue culture success.<br><br>6. Micropropagation is the method of producing thousands of plants in very short durations through tissue culture, enabling rapid plant multiplication.<br><br>7. The nutrient medium for tissue culture must provide a carbon source (sucrose) along with inorganic salts, vitamins, amino acids and growth regulators like auxins and cytokinins.<br><br>8. Advantages of micropropagation include propagation of large numbers of plants in short time periods, independent of seasons.<br><br>9. Plants produced through micropropagation are genetically identical to the original plant, creating somaclones.<br><br>10. Food plants like tomato, banana, and apple have been successfully produced on commercial scale using micropropagation methods.<br><br>11. Tissue culture can be used to recover healthy plants from diseased ones, even those infected with viruses or systemic pathogens.<br><br>12. Meristem culture is the best method to obtain virus-free plants by growing meristem tissue in vitro to obtain pathogen-free plants.<br><br>13. Scientists have successfully cultured meristems of banana, sugarcane, and potato to obtain virus-free plants for commercial production.<br><br>14. Protoplasts are plant cells without cell walls, obtained by enzymatic digestion of cell walls, and can be isolated as single cells.<br><br>15. Isolated protoplasts from two different plant varieties (each having desirable characteristics) can be fused to create hybrid protoplasts.<br><br>16. Somatic hybrids are new plants developed from hybrid protoplasts, and the process is called somatic hybridization.<br><br>17. Hybrid protoplasts surrounded by plasma membranes can be further grown to form a new plant through somatic hybridization technique. "],

B. thuringiensis forms protein crystals during a particular phase of growth containing toxic insecticidal proteins.<br><br>11. The crystals in B. thuringiensis contain insecticidal protein that exists as inactive protoxins within the bacterium, preventing self-toxicity.<br><br>12. The Bt toxin protein does not kill the bacterium itself because it exists in an inactive form (protoxin) inside bacterial cells.<br><br>13.

A novel strategy based on RNA interference (RNAi) was adopted to prevent nematode infestation in tobacco plants.<br><br>10. RNAi takes place in all eukaryotic organisms as a method of cellular defense against foreign genetic material.<br><br>11.

Nematode-specific genes were introduced into tobacco plants using Agrobacterium vectors as shown in Figure 10.2.<br><br>14. The introduction of DNA produces both sense and antisense RNA in the host plant cells simultaneously.<br><br>15. These two RNAs being complementary to each other form a double stranded RNA (dsRNA) that initiates RNAi process.<br><br>16. The consequence of RNAi is that the parasite could not survive in a transgenic host expressing specific interfering RNA.<br><br>17. The host plant gets itself protected from the parasite through the RNAi mechanism, providing natural pest resistance.<br><br>18.

} ], " NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Figure 10.3 shows maturation of pro-insulin into insulin, depicting proinsulin with A peptide, B peptide, and C peptide components.<br><br>2. In mammals including humans, insulin is synthesized as a pro-hormone (like a pro-enzyme) which needs to be processed before becoming fully mature and functional.<br><br>3. The pro-hormone proinsulin contains an extra stretch called the C peptide that is not present in mature insulin.<br><br>4. The C peptide is removed during maturation of proinsulin into insulin, resulting in the final functional insulin molecule.<br><br>5. The main challenge for producing insulin using rDNA techniques in 1983 was getting insulin assembled into a mature form.<br><br>6. Eli Lilly company in 1983 prepared two DNA sequences corresponding to A and B chains of human insulin and introduced them into plasmids of E. coli.<br><br>7. Chains A and B of insulin were produced separately in E. coli, extracted, and combined by creating disulphide bonds to form human insulin.<br><br>8. Section 10.2.2 on Gene Therapy discusses treatment of hereditary diseases through genetic correction methods.<br><br>9. Gene therapy is a collection of methods that allows correction of a gene defect diagnosed in a child or embryo.<br><br>10. Correction of genetic defect involves delivery of a normal gene into the individual or embryo to compensate for the non-functional gene.<br><br>11. The first clinical gene therapy was given in 1990 to a 4-year-old girl with adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency.<br><br>12. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) enzyme is crucial for the immune system to function properly.<br><br>13. In some children, ADA deficiency can be treated by bone marrow transplantation or enzyme replacement therapy where functional ADA is given by injection.<br><br>14. Bone marrow transplantation and enzyme replacement therapy approaches are not completely curative for ADA deficiency.<br><br>15. As an alternate approach, lymphocytes from the patient's blood are grown in culture outside the body for gene therapy treatment.<br><br>16. A functional ADA cDNA using a retroviral vector is introduced into these cultured lymphocytes, which are then returned to the patient.<br><br>17. As these genetically engineered lymphocytes are not immortal, the patient requires periodic infusion of such cells.<br><br>18. If the gene isolated from bone marrow cells is introduced into cells at early embryonic stages, it could provide a permanent cure for ADA deficiency.<br><br>19. Section 10.2.3 on Molecular Diagnosis begins by stating that early diagnosis and understanding pathophysiology is very important for effective disease treatment.<br><br>20. Conventional methods of diagnosis have limitations in early disease detection, leading to development of molecular diagnostic techniques. "],

Very low concentration of bacteria or virus at a time when disease symptoms are not yet visible can be detected by amplification of their nucleic acid by PCR.<br><br>3. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) can amplify a single copy of DNA to detect very low amounts of DNA in samples.<br><br>4. PCR is now routinely used to detect HIV in suspected AIDS patients, enabling early diagnosis before symptoms appear.<br><br>5. PCR is being used to detect mutations in genes in suspected cancer patients, making it a powerful technique for cancer diagnosis.<br><br>6. PCR is a powerful technique to identify many other genetic disorders beyond HIV and cancer.<br><br>7. A single stranded DNA or RNA tagged with a radioactive molecule (probe) is allowed to hybridize to its complementary DNA in a clone of cells.<br><br>8. Detection of hybridized probe is done using autoradiography technique which uses photographic film to detect radioactive signals.<br><br>9. The clone having the mutated gene will appear on the photographic film because the probe will not have complementarity with the mutated gene.<br><br>10. ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immuno-sorbent Assay) is based on the principle of antigen-antibody interaction for disease detection.<br><br>11. Infection by pathogen can be detected by the presence of antigens (proteins, glycoproteins, etc.) produced by the pathogen.<br><br>12. Infection can also be detected by detecting the antibodies synthesized against the pathogen by the host immune system.<br><br>13. Section 10.3 introduces Transgenic Animals - animals that have had their DNA manipulated to possess and express an extra (foreign) gene.<br><br>14. Examples of transgenic animals include transgenic rats, rabbits, pigs, sheep, cows and fish produced for various research purposes.<br><br>15. Over 95% of existing transgenic animals are mice, making them the most common model organism for transgenic research.<br><br>16. Transgenic animals are produced to study normal physiology and development by allowing study of how genes are regulated and affect body functions.<br><br>17. Transgenic animals help in study of disease by increasing understanding of how genes contribute to the development of disease.<br><br>18. Transgenic animals serve as models for human diseases enabling investigation of new treatments for various conditions.<br><br>19. Today transgenic models exist for many human diseases such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer's disease.<br><br>20.

Transgenic animals can produce useful biological products by introducing the portion of DNA coding for a particular product into their genome.<br><br>3. Human protein α-1-antitrypsin is used to treat emphysema and can be produced using transgenic animals for cost-effective production.<br><br>4. Similar attempts are being made for treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU) and cystic fibrosis using transgenic animal-derived biological products.<br><br>5. In 1997, the first transgenic cow named Rosie produced human protein-enriched milk containing human alpha-lactalbumin.<br><br>6. The milk from transgenic cow Rosie contained 2.4 grams per litre of human alpha-lactalbumin protein.<br><br>7. Milk from Rosie was nutritionally a more balanced product for human babies than natural cow-milk due to human alpha-lactalbumin content.<br><br>8. Transgenic mice are being developed for use in testing the safety of vaccines before using them on humans.<br><br>9. Transgenic mice are being used to test the safety of the polio vaccine before human administration.<br><br>10. Transgenic rabbits and monkeys are also used to test the safety of batches of vaccines for quality control purposes.<br><br>11. Chemical safety testing is also known as toxicity testing or safety testing of drugs and toxic substances.<br><br>12. The purpose of toxicity testing is to determine the safety of drugs before they are used for human treatment.<br><br>13. Transgenic animals for toxicity testing are made that carry genes which make them more sensitive to toxic substances than non-transgenic animals.<br><br>14. These sensitive transgenic animals are exposed to the toxic substances and the effects are studied for safety assessment.<br><br>15. Toxicity testing in transgenic animals allows us to obtain results in less time compared to conventional testing methods.<br><br>16. Section 10.4 on Ethical Issues discusses that manipulation of living organisms by humans cannot go on without regulation.<br><br>17. Some ethical standards are required to evaluate the morality of all human activities that might help or harm living organisms.<br><br>18. Genetic modification of organisms can have unpredictable results when such organisms are introduced into the ecosystem.<br><br>19. The Indian Government has set up GEAC (Genetic Engineering Approval Committee) to make decisions regarding validity of GM research.<br><br>20. GEAC makes decisions regarding the safety of introducing GM organisms for public services like food and medicine sources.<br><br>21. The modification and usage of living organisms for public services has raised problems with patents granted for biological resources.<br><br>22.

  }], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Population Definition: A population is a group of individuals of the same species mainly sharing or competing for similar resources, potentially interbreeding and thus constitute a real discrete and identifiable unit.<br><br>2. Population Examples: All cormorants in a wetland, rats in an abandoned dwelling, teakwood trees in a forest tract, bacteria in a culture plate and lotus plants in a pond are examples of populations.<br><br>3. Population Attributes: A population has certain attributes that an individual organism does not possess - birth rates, death rates, sex ratio and age distribution.<br><br>4. Birth Rate Calculation: If in a pond there are 20 lotus plants last year and through reproduction 8 new plants are added, the birth rate or natality is 8 divided by 20 equals 0.4 offspring per lotus per year.<br><br>5. Death Rate Calculation: If 3 plants died during the year out of initial 20, the death rate or mortality is 3 divided by 20 equals 0.15 offspring per lotus per year.<br><br>6. Sex Ratio Definition: An individual may be a male or a female but a population has a sex ratio. Example: 60 percent of population are females and 40 percent males gives ratio 60:40 or 3:2.<br><br>7. Age Distribution: Age composition or age distribution is another attribute of a population referring to the percentage of individuals of different age groups.<br><br>8. Age Pyramid: When percentage of individuals of a given age or age group is plotted for the population, the resulting structure is called the age pyramid.<br><br>9. Age Pyramid Shapes: The shape of the age pyramid reflects the growth status - triangular shape indicates expanding population, bell shape indicates stable population, urn shape indicates declining population.<br><br>10. Connection to Evolution: Population ecology is an important area because it links ecology to population genetics and evolution through studying population attributes. "],

Four Factors Affecting Population: Population density is affected by four basic processes - Natality (B), Mortality (D), Immigration (I), and Emigration (E).<br><br>2. Natality Definition: Natality refers to the number of births during a given period in the population that are added to the initial density. It contributes to increase in population density.<br><br>3. Mortality Definition: Mortality is the number of deaths in the population during a given period. It contributes to decrease in population density.<br><br>4. Immigration Definition: Immigration is the number of individuals of the same species that have come into the habitat from elsewhere during the time period under consideration. It increases population density.<br><br>5. Emigration Definition: Emigration is the number of individuals of the population who left the habitat and gone elsewhere during the time period under consideration. It decreases population density.<br><br>6. Population Density Formula: If N is the population density at time t, then its density at time t + 1 is: Nt+1 = Nt + [(B + I) - (D + E)].<br><br>7. Population Increase Condition: Population density will increase if the number of births plus immigrants (B + I) is more than the number of deaths plus emigrants (D + E).<br><br>8. Normal Conditions: Under normal conditions, births and deaths are the most important factors influencing population density. Immigration and Emigration assume importance only under special conditions.<br><br>9. Special Conditions: If a new habitat is just being colonized, immigration may contribute more significantly to population growth than birth rates.<br><br>10.

The population grows in an exponential or geometric fashion.<br><br>2. Darwin's Observation: Darwin observed exponential growth while developing his theory of natural selection, noting that populations have the ability to grow rapidly when resources are unlimited.<br><br>3. Growth Rate Formula: If birth rate per capita is b and death rate per capita is d, then the rate of change in population dN/dt = (b - d) × N.<br><br>4. Simplified Form: Let (b - d) = r, then dN/dt = rN, where r is the intrinsic rate of natural increase.<br><br>5. Intrinsic Rate (r): The r in the equation is called the intrinsic rate of natural increase and is a very important parameter for assessing impacts of any biotic or abiotic factor on population growth.<br><br>6. r Values Examples: For Norway rat, r = 0.015. For human population in 1981, r value was 0.0205. In 1981, what the current r value is for calculating it, you need to know the birth and death rates.<br><br>7. J-shaped Curve: Exponential growth results in a J-shaped curve when population size (N) is plotted against time. This indicates unlimited resources.<br><br>8. Integral Form Equation: Using integral calculus, the exponential growth equation is Nt = N0 e^rt, where Nt is population after time t, N0 is initial population, r is intrinsic rate, and e is base of natural logarithms (2.71828).<br><br>9. Rapid Growth Potential: Any species growing exponentially under unlimited resource conditions can reach enormous population densities in a short time.<br><br>10. Exponential vs Logistic: When resources are not limiting, growth plot is exponential (J-shaped). When resources are limiting, growth is logistic (S-shaped) with carrying capacity K. "],

S-shaped Growth: When resources are limited, population eventually exhibits S-shaped or sigmoid growth curve.<br><br>4. Four Phases of Logistic Growth: A population growing in a habitat with limited resources shows initially a lag phase, followed by phases of acceleration and deceleration and finally an asymptote.<br><br>5. Asymptote Definition: When the population density reaches the carrying capacity, it reaches asymptote phase. Asymptote is obtained when K equals N.<br><br>6. Verhulst-Pearl Logistic Growth: This type of population growth is called Verhulst-Pearl Logistic Growth and produces a sigmoid curve.<br><br>7. Logistic Growth Equation: The equation is dN/dt = rN[(K-N)/K], where N is population density at time t, r is intrinsic rate of natural increase, and K is carrying capacity.<br><br>8. Carrying Capacity (K): K represents the maximum population size that the environment can sustain indefinitely with available resources.<br><br>9. Growth Limiting Factor: The factor [(K-N)/K] represents the fraction of carrying capacity available for further growth. When N approaches K, this factor approaches zero, slowing growth.<br><br>10. Maximum Growth Rate: In logistic growth, the population growth rate is maximum when N equals K/2, which is the inflection point of the S-shaped curve.<br><br>11. Comparison with Exponential: Unlike exponential growth (J-shaped curve with unlimited resources), logistic growth (S-shaped curve) occurs with limited resources and plateaus at carrying capacity.<br><br>12.

Predator Role in Diversity: Predators help in maintaining species diversity in a community by reducing the intensity of competition among competing prey species.<br><br>2. Pisaster Starfish: Among rocky intertidal communities of the American Pacific Coast, the starfish Pisaster is an important predator. When experimentally removed, more than 10 species of invertebrates became extinct within a year due to interspecific competition.<br><br>3. Prey Defense - Camouflage: Some species of insects and frogs are cryptically-colored (camouflaged) to avoid being detected easily by predators.<br><br>4. Prey Defense - Poison: Some prey species are poisonous and therefore avoided by predators.<br><br>5. Monarch Butterfly: The monarch butterfly is highly distasteful to its predator (bird) because of a special chemical present in its body. The butterfly acquires this chemical during its caterpillar stage by feeding on a poisonous weed.<br><br>6. Morphological Defence: Thorns (Acacia, Cactus) are the most common morphological means of defence in plants against herbivory.<br><br>7. Chemical Defence in Plants: Many plants produce and store chemicals that make herbivores sick when eaten, inhibit feeding or digestion, disrupt reproduction or even kill them.<br><br>8. Calotropis Example: The weed Calotropis produces highly poisonous cardiac glycosides, which is why cattle or goats never browse on this plant.<br><br>9. Commercial Plant Products: Nicotine, caffeine, quinine, strychnine, opium etc. extracted commercially from plants are actually produced by them as defences against grazers and browsers.<br><br>10. Secondary Metabolites: Plants produce secondary metabolites (alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, phenolics) that have evolved in response to herbivory. Many herbivore species have evolved adaptations to overcome these chemical defences.<br><br>11. Competition Definition: Competition occurs when closely related species compete for the same resources that are in short supply.<br><br>12. Unrelated Species Competition: Unrelated species could also compete for the same resource. Example: In shallow South American lakes, visiting flamingos and resident fishes compete for the same zooplankton.<br><br>13. Resources Not Always Limiting: Resources need not be limiting for competition to occur. In interference competition, feeding efficiency of one species might be reduced due to interfering presence of other species even if resources are abundant."],
