RNA polymerase II transcribes precursor of mRNA, the heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA).<br><br>4. The primary transcripts contain both exons and introns and are non-functional.<br><br>5.

Big Bang talks of huge explosion that occurred 20 billion years back.<br><br>7. Big Bang explosion is unimaginable in physical terms.<br><br>8. Universe expanded and hence temperature came down.<br><br>9. Hydrogen and Helium formed sometime later after Big Bang.<br><br>10. Gases condensed under gravitation and formed galaxies of present day universe.<br><br>11. In solar system of Milky Way galaxy, earth was supposed to have been formed about 4.5 billion years back.<br><br>12. There was no atmosphere in early earth.<br><br>13. Water vapour, methane, carbon dioxide and ammonia released from molten mass covered surface of early earth.<br><br>14. UV rays from sun broke up water into Hydrogen and Oxygen.<br><br>15. Lighter H2 escaped from early earth atmosphere.<br><br>16. Oxygen combined with ammonia and methane to form water, CO2 and others.<br><br>17. Ozone layer was formed on earth.<br><br>18. As earth cooled, water vapour fell as rain.<br><br>19. Water vapour condensed and rain filled all depressions to form oceans.<br><br>20. Life appeared almost four billion years back.<br><br>21. Early Greek thinkers thought units of life called spores were transferred to different planets including earth.<br><br>22. Spores is the unit, and it was favourite idea for some astronomers.<br><br>23. For long time it was believed that life came from outer space.<br><br>24. Some scientists believe that life came from outside earth.<br><br>25. Theory of life from spores was called theory of spontaneous generation.<br><br>26. Louis Pasteur by careful experimentation demonstrated that life comes only from pre-existing life.<br><br>27. Pasteur showed that in pre-sterilised flasks, life did not come from killed yeast.<br><br>28. In similar flasks open to air, new living organisms arose from dead yeast.<br><br>29. Spontaneous generation theory was dismissed once and for all.<br><br>30. However, this did not answer question how first life form came into existence.<br><br>31. Oparin of Russia and Haldane of England proposed that first form of life could have come from pre-existing non-living organic molecules.<br><br>32. Examples of pre-existing non-living organic molecules are RNA, protein etc.<br><br>33. Formation of life was preceded by chemical evolution.<br><br>34. Chemical evolution is formation of diverse organic molecules from inorganic constituents.<br><br>35. Conditions on early earth were high temperature, volcanic storms, reducing atmosphere.<br><br>36. Reducing atmosphere contained CH4, NH3 etc.<br><br>37. In 1953, S.L. Miller, an American scientist, created similar conditions in laboratory scale.<br><br>38. Miller created electric discharge in closed flask containing CH4, H2, NH3 and water vapour at 800 degrees C.<br><br>39. Miller observed formation of amino acids in his experiment.<br><br>40. In similar experiments others observed formation of sugars, nitrogen bases, pigment and fats.<br><br>41. Analysis of meteorite content also revealed similar compounds.<br><br>42.

When we describe story of life on earth, we treat evolution as consequence of process called natural selection.<br><br>3. Work of Thomas Malthus on populations possibly influenced Darwin.<br><br>4. Natural selection is based on certain observations which are factual.<br><br>5. Natural resources are limited.<br><br>6. Populations are stable in size except seasonal fluctuations.<br><br>7. Members of population vary in characteristics meaning no two individuals are alike even though they look superficially similar.<br><br>8. Most of variations are inherited.<br><br>9. Theoretically population size will grow exponentially if everybody reproduced maximally.<br><br>10. Growing bacterial population in lab doubles every generation.<br><br>11. In reality, exponential growth is not true because there has been competition for resources.<br><br>12. Only some survived and grew at expense of others that could not flourish.<br><br>13. Darwin asserted that variations which are heritable and make resource utilisation better will enable only those to reproduce and leave more progeny.<br><br>14. Over period of time, over many generations, there would be change in population characteristic and hence new forms appear to arise.<br><br>15. Hugo de Vries based his work on evening primrose.<br><br>16. Hugo de Vries brought forth idea of mutations - large difference arising suddenly in population.<br><br>17. Hugo de Vries believed that it is mutation which causes evolution and not minor variations that Darwin talked about.<br><br>18. Mutations are random and directionless.<br><br>19. Darwinian variations are small and directional.<br><br>20. Evolution for Darwin was gradual.<br><br>21. De Vries believed mutation caused speciation and hence called it saltation or single step large mutation.<br><br>22. Later it was realised that pre-existing advantageous mutations when selected will result in observation of new phenotypes. "],

Beverages like wine, beer, whisky, brandy and rum are produced using microbes.<br><br>3. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the same yeast used for both bread-making and fermenting malted cereals and fruit juices.<br><br>4. Saccharomyces cerevisiae ferments malted cereals and fruit juices to produce ethanol.<br><br>5. Beverages with low alcohol content are called beers.<br><br>6. Whiskey, brandy, rum and wine are produced by distillation of fermented broth.<br><br>7. Wine and beer are produced without distillation.<br><br>8. Brewers yeast has been used from ancient times for preparation of beer.<br><br>9. Beer is essentially a brewed alcoholic beverage.<br><br>10. Antibiotics are substances produced by bacteria and fungi.<br><br>11. Antibiotics are capable of killing or inhibiting growth of other disease-causing microbes.<br><br>12. Antibiotics are regarded as one of the most significant discoveries of the twentieth century.<br><br>13. Penicillin was the first antibiotic to be discovered and it was a chance discovery.<br><br>14. Alexander Fleming was working on Staphylococci bacteria when he discovered penicillin.<br><br>15. Penicillium notatum is a mould that grew accidentally in Flemings unwashed culture plate.<br><br>16. Penicillium notatum inhibited the growth of Staphylococci bacteria.<br><br>17. Fleming concluded that the mould produces a chemical that inhibits bacterial growth.<br><br>18.

Penicillin was used for treating American soldiers during World War II.<br><br>21. Fleming, Florey and Chain were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1945 for penicillin discovery.<br><br>22. After Penicillin, other antibiotics were isolated from other microbes.<br><br>23. Erythromycin is produced by Streptomyces erythraea.<br><br>24. Streptomycin is produced by Streptomyces griseus.<br><br>25. A large number of new antibiotics have been discovered to take care of increasing drug resistant microbes.<br><br>26. Microbes are used for commercial and industrial production of certain chemicals.<br><br>27. Chemicals produced by microbes include organic acids, alcohols and enzymes.<br><br>28.

Sewage treatment is carried out in two stages: primary treatment and secondary treatment.<br><br>3. Primary treatment steps basically involve physical removal of particles from sewage.<br><br>4. Physical removal in primary treatment includes filtration and sedimentation.<br><br>5. Particles are removed in stages during primary treatment - large and small particles.<br><br>6. Initially, floating debris is removed by sequential filtration.<br><br>7. Grit consisting of soil and small pebbles are removed by sedimentation.<br><br>8. All solids that settle during primary treatment form the primary sludge.<br><br>9. The supernatant after primary treatment forms the effluent.<br><br>10. The effluent from the primary settling tank is taken for secondary treatment.<br><br>11. Secondary treatment is also called biological treatment.<br><br>12. The primary effluent is passed into large aeration tanks during secondary treatment.<br><br>13. In aeration tanks, effluent is constantly agitated mechanically.<br><br>14. Air is pumped into the aeration tanks during secondary treatment.<br><br>15. Mechanical agitation and air pumping allow vigorous growth of useful aerobic microbes.<br><br>16. Aerobic microbes grow into flocs during secondary treatment.<br><br>17. Flocs are masses of bacteria associated with fungal filaments to form mesh like structures.<br><br>18. While growing, these microbes consume the major part of organic matter in the effluent.<br><br>19. Microbial growth significantly reduces the BOD of the effluent.<br><br>20.

Sewage water is treated till the BOD is reduced.<br><br>23. The BOD test measures the rate of uptake of oxygen by micro-organisms in a sample of water.<br><br>24. Indirectly, BOD is a measure of the organic matter present in the water.<br><br>25. The greater the BOD of waste water, more is its polluting potential.<br><br>26. Once BOD is reduced significantly, effluent is passed into a settling tank.<br><br>27. In the settling tank, bacterial flocs are allowed to sediment.<br><br>28.

  }], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. The following are the features that are required to facilitate cloning into a vector: origin of replication, selectable marker, and cloning sites.<br><br>2. Origin of replication (ori) is a sequence from where replication starts in the vector DNA molecule.<br><br>3. Any piece of DNA when linked to ori sequence can be made to replicate within the host cells through the vector.<br><br>4. The ori sequence is also responsible for controlling the copy number of the linked DNA in the host cell.<br><br>5. If one wants to recover many copies of the target DNA, it should be cloned in a vector whose origin supports high copy number.<br><br>6. In addition to ori, the vector requires a selectable marker which helps in identifying and eliminating non-transformants.<br><br>7. Selectable marker also helps in selectively permitting the growth of the transformants containing the recombinant DNA.<br><br>8. Transformation is a procedure through which a piece of DNA is introduced in a host bacterium for cloning purposes.<br><br>9. Genes encoding resistance to antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline or kanamycin are considered useful selectable markers for E. coli.<br><br>10. The normal E. coli cells do not carry resistance against any of these antibiotics, making them suitable for selection.<br><br>11. For cloning sites, the vector needs to have very few, preferably single, recognition sites for the commonly used restriction enzymes.<br><br>12. Presence of more than one recognition sites within the vector will generate several fragments, which will complicate the gene cloning process.<br><br>13. The ligation of alien DNA is carried out at a restriction site present in one of the two antibiotic resistance genes in the vector.<br><br>14. For example, foreign DNA can be ligated at the BamH I site of tetracycline resistance gene in the vector pBR322.<br><br>15. pBR322 is a modified bacterial plasmid frequently used as a vector for cloning genes in E. coli host cells.<br><br>16. In pBR322, P stands for plasmid, B and R are the names of scientists Boliver and Rodriguez, and 322 is a distinguishing number.<br><br>17. The recombinant plasmids will lose tetracycline resistance due to insertion of foreign DNA at BamH I site in the tet gene.<br><br>18. Recombinant plasmids can still be selected out from non-recombinants by plating transformants on ampicillin containing medium.<br><br>19. Transformants growing on ampicillin medium are then transferred to medium containing tetracycline to distinguish recombinants from non-recombinants.<br><br>20. Non-recombinants will grow on medium containing both antibiotics, while recombinants will only grow on ampicillin medium.<br><br>21. In this selection process, one antibiotic resistance gene helps in selecting transformants while the other helps in identifying recombinants.<br><br>22. Figure 9.4 shows E. coli cloning vector pBR322 with restriction sites (Hind III, EcoR I, BamH I, Sal I, Pvu II, Pst I, Cla I), ori and antibiotic resistance genes.<br><br>23. The pBR322 vector contains ampR (ampicillin resistance gene) and tetR (tetracycline resistance gene) as selectable markers.<br><br>24. The rop gene in pBR322 codes for proteins involved in the replication of the plasmid and helps control copy number."],

Blue colonies indicate non-recombinant bacteria where the beta-galactosidase gene remains functional and produces blue color.<br><br>6. Selection of recombinants due to inactivation of antibiotics is a cumbersome procedure requiring simultaneous plating on two different antibiotic plates.<br><br>7. Alternative selectable markers have been developed which differentiate recombinants from non-recombinants based on color production with chromogenic substrate.<br><br>8. In alternative selection method, recombinant DNA is inserted within the coding sequence of an enzyme beta-galactosidase causing its inactivation.<br><br>9. Insertional inactivation refers to inactivation of gene for synthesis of beta-galactosidase enzyme when foreign DNA is inserted into it.<br><br>10.

After ice incubation, cells are placed briefly at 42 degree C (heat shock) and then put back on ice to enable bacteria to take up recombinant DNA.<br><br>3. The correct sequence of making cells competent is: treatment with divalent cations then incubation with rDNA on ice then heat shock at 42 degree C then placed on ice.<br><br>4. Heat shock at 42 degree C for brief period increases cell membrane permeability, facilitating DNA uptake by competent bacterial cells.<br><br>5. Micro-injection is a method where recombinant DNA is directly injected into the nucleus of an animal cell using fine glass pipette.<br><br>6. Biolistics or gene gun is a method suitable for plants where cells are bombarded with high velocity micro-particles of gold or tungsten coated with DNA.<br><br>7.

} ], " NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. PCR uses two sets of primers which are small chemically synthesized oligonucleotides that are complementary to the regions of DNA to be amplified.<br><br>2. The enzyme DNA polymerase used in PCR is isolated from the bacterium Thermus aquaticus and is called Taq polymerase.<br><br>3. The DNA polymerase enzyme extends the primers using the nucleotides provided in the reaction and the genomic DNA as template.<br><br>4. If the process of replication of DNA in PCR is repeated many times, the segment of DNA can be amplified to approximately billion times.<br><br>5. Repeated amplification in PCR is achieved by the use of a thermostable DNA polymerase isolated from bacterium Thermus aquaticus.<br><br>6. Thermostable DNA polymerase (Taq polymerase) remains active during the high temperature induced denaturation of double stranded DNA in PCR.<br><br>7. Taq polymerase is a thermostable DNA polymerase used in PCR, not inactive at high temperature as it functions at 72 degree C during extension step.<br><br>8. The thermostable enzymes Taq and Pfu isolated from thermophilic bacteria are DNA polymerases used in PCR applications.<br><br>9. The amplified DNA fragment from PCR can be used to ligate with a vector for further cloning as shown in Figure 9.6.<br><br>10. Section 9.3.4 covers Insertion of Recombinant DNA into the Host Cell/Organism with several methods for introducing ligated DNA.<br><br>11. Recipient cells are made competent to receive and take up DNA present in their surrounding environment through transformation.<br><br>12. If recombinant DNA bearing gene for resistance to antibiotic ampicillin is transferred into E. coli cells, the host cells become transformed into ampicillin-resistant cells.<br><br>13. When transformed cells are spread on agar plates containing ampicillin, only transformants will grow while untransformed recipient cells will die.<br><br>14. The ampicillin resistance gene that allows selection of transformed cells in the presence of ampicillin is called a selectable marker.<br><br>15. Useful selectable markers for E. coli include genes for resistance to antibiotics like ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline or kanamycin.<br><br>16. Genes encoding proteins that degrade antibiotics would NOT be useful selectable markers as they would allow all cells to survive.<br><br>17. Section 9.3.5 covers Obtaining the Foreign Gene Product as the ultimate aim of most recombinant DNA technologies.<br><br>18. When alien DNA is inserted into cloning vector and transferred into bacterial, plant or animal cell, the alien DNA gets multiplied.<br><br>19. In almost all recombinant technologies, the ultimate aim is to produce a desirable protein, so the recombinant DNA needs to be expressed.<br><br>20. If any protein encoding gene is expressed in a heterologous host, it is called a recombinant protein.<br><br>21. Cells harboring cloned genes of interest may be grown on small scale in laboratory for extracting and purifying the desired protein.<br><br>22. Different separation techniques are used for extracting the desired protein and then purifying it from cell cultures.<br><br>23. Cells can be multiplied in continuous culture system where used medium is drained from one side while fresh medium is added from other side.<br><br>24. Downstream processing occurs after the completion of the biosynthetic stage and involves processes that make products ready for marketing.<br><br>25. The process of separation and purification of expressed protein before marketing is specifically called downstream processing. "],

Continuous culture method produces a larger biomass leading to higher yields of desired proteins compared to batch culture.<br><br>3. A distinct advantage of continuous culture over batch culture is higher productivity with continuous production of proteins.<br><br>4. Small volume cultures cannot yield appreciable quantities of products, necessitating the development of large-scale bioreactors.<br><br>5. To produce in large quantities, bioreactors where large volumes (100-1000 litres) of culture can be processed were developed.<br><br>6. Bioreactors can be thought of as vessels in which raw materials are biologically converted into specific products like proteins and enzymes.<br><br>7. Bioreactors use microbial, plant, animal or human cells to convert raw materials into desired biotechnological products.<br><br>8. A bioreactor provides optimal conditions for achieving the desired product by providing optimum growth rate through controlled parameters.<br><br>9. The optimal conditions provided by bioreactor include temperature, pH, substrate, salts, vitamins, and oxygen for cell growth.<br><br>10. The most commonly used bioreactors are of stirring type, shown in Figure 9.7 on this page.<br><br>11. Figure 9.7 shows two types of bioreactors: (a) Simple stirred-tank bioreactor and (b) Sparged stirred tank bioreactor.<br><br>12. A stirred-tank reactor is usually cylindrical or with a curved base to facilitate the mixing of the reactor contents.<br><br>13. The stirrer in bioreactor facilitates even mixing and oxygen availability throughout the bioreactor for all cells.<br><br>14. In simple stirred tank bioreactor, mixing is done solely by stirring without sparging of air bubbles.<br><br>15. In sparged stirred tank bioreactor, sterile air can be bubbled through the reactor to increase oxygen transfer.<br><br>16. Air bubbles in sparged stirred tank bioreactor dramatically increase the oxygen transfer area for aerobic cell growth.<br><br>17. The role of air bubbles sparged into bioreactor tanks is to increase the surface area for oxygen transfer, not to remove foam.<br><br>18. The bioreactor has an agitator system for mixing, an oxygen delivery system for aeration, and a foam control system.<br><br>19. A bioreactor also has a temperature control system, pH control system, and sampling ports for periodic culture withdrawal.<br><br>20. Sampling ports allow small volumes of the culture to be withdrawn periodically for monitoring growth and product formation.<br><br>21. Section 9.3.6 introduces Downstream Processing as post-biosynthetic processing before marketing the finished product.<br><br>22. After completion of the biosynthetic stage, the product has to be subjected through a series of processes before marketing.<br><br>23. Downstream processing includes separation and purification of the desired product from the bioreactor culture.<br><br>24. Downstream processing occurs after the biosynthetic phase when the product has been produced in the bioreactor.<br><br>25. Separation and purification by filtration, centrifugation of desired compound produced in bioreactor is part of downstream processing only.<br><br>26.

Quality control testing does not include separation and purification steps; these are part of downstream processing.<br><br>12. Downstream processing typically involves three primary areas: cell interruption, decontamination segments, and cleaning segment.<br><br>13. The steps of downstream processing include: removal of insolubles, product isolation, and purification of products.<br><br>14. Insolubles like cell debris are removed from fermentation broth by centrifugation, filtration, sedimentation, or precipitation.<br><br>15. Product isolation involves elimination of elements differing from properties of desired product, mainly water removal.<br><br>16. Purification of products involves separation of contaminants closely imitating the product in physical and chemical properties.<br><br>17. Operations in purification include size exclusion, affinity, ion exchange, reversed-phase chromatography, and crystallization.<br><br>18.

Biotechnology applications extend to processed food production, waste management, energy production, and downstream processing technologies for product purification.<br><br>4. Three main approaches for increasing food production are agro-chemical based agriculture, organic agriculture, and genetically engineered crop-based agriculture.<br><br>5. Genetically modified crops are produced using recombinant DNA technology to introduce desired traits like pest resistance, drought tolerance, and enhanced nutritional value.<br><br>6. GM crops help reduce reliance on chemical pesticides by incorporating genes for pest resistance, making them more environmentally sustainable.<br><br>7. Agro-chemical based agriculture uses fertilizers and pesticides to increase yield but can be expensive for farmers in developing countries.<br><br>8. Organic agriculture focuses on natural farming methods without synthetic chemicals, promoting environmental sustainability.<br><br>9.

The Green Revolution succeeded in tripling the food supply but was largely due to improved crop varieties and better management practices using agrochemicals.<br><br>2. Agrochemicals like fertilizers and pesticides are expensive and often unaffordable for farmers in developing countries, creating economic challenges.<br><br>3. Traditional breeding techniques failed to keep pace with increasing food demand, leading to development of modern tissue culture techniques in the 1950s.<br><br>4. Tissue culture is the technique of growing whole plants from explants (any part of plant taken out) in test tubes under sterile conditions in special nutrient media.<br><br>5. Totipotency is the capacity of any cell or explant to generate a complete plant, fundamental principle behind tissue culture success.<br><br>6. Micropropagation is the method of producing thousands of plants in very short durations through tissue culture, enabling rapid plant multiplication.<br><br>7. The nutrient medium for tissue culture must provide a carbon source (sucrose) along with inorganic salts, vitamins, amino acids and growth regulators like auxins and cytokinins.<br><br>8. Advantages of micropropagation include propagation of large numbers of plants in short time periods, independent of seasons.<br><br>9. Plants produced through micropropagation are genetically identical to the original plant, creating somaclones.<br><br>10. Food plants like tomato, banana, and apple have been successfully produced on commercial scale using micropropagation methods.<br><br>11. Tissue culture can be used to recover healthy plants from diseased ones, even those infected with viruses or systemic pathogens.<br><br>12. Meristem culture is the best method to obtain virus-free plants by growing meristem tissue in vitro to obtain pathogen-free plants.<br><br>13. Scientists have successfully cultured meristems of banana, sugarcane, and potato to obtain virus-free plants for commercial production.<br><br>14. Protoplasts are plant cells without cell walls, obtained by enzymatic digestion of cell walls, and can be isolated as single cells.<br><br>15. Isolated protoplasts from two different plant varieties (each having desirable characteristics) can be fused to create hybrid protoplasts.<br><br>16. Somatic hybrids are new plants developed from hybrid protoplasts, and the process is called somatic hybridization.<br><br>17. Hybrid protoplasts surrounded by plasma membranes can be further grown to form a new plant through somatic hybridization technique. "],

PCR is being used to detect mutations in genes in suspected cancer patients, making it a powerful technique for cancer diagnosis.<br><br>6. PCR is a powerful technique to identify many other genetic disorders beyond HIV and cancer.<br><br>7. A single stranded DNA or RNA tagged with a radioactive molecule (probe) is allowed to hybridize to its complementary DNA in a clone of cells.<br><br>8. Detection of hybridized probe is done using autoradiography technique which uses photographic film to detect radioactive signals.<br><br>9. The clone having the mutated gene will appear on the photographic film because the probe will not have complementarity with the mutated gene.<br><br>10. ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immuno-sorbent Assay) is based on the principle of antigen-antibody interaction for disease detection.<br><br>11. Infection by pathogen can be detected by the presence of antigens (proteins, glycoproteins, etc.) produced by the pathogen.<br><br>12. Infection can also be detected by detecting the antibodies synthesized against the pathogen by the host immune system.<br><br>13. Section 10.3 introduces Transgenic Animals - animals that have had their DNA manipulated to possess and express an extra (foreign) gene.<br><br>14. Examples of transgenic animals include transgenic rats, rabbits, pigs, sheep, cows and fish produced for various research purposes.<br><br>15. Over 95% of existing transgenic animals are mice, making them the most common model organism for transgenic research.<br><br>16. Transgenic animals are produced to study normal physiology and development by allowing study of how genes are regulated and affect body functions.<br><br>17. Transgenic animals help in study of disease by increasing understanding of how genes contribute to the development of disease.<br><br>18. Transgenic animals serve as models for human diseases enabling investigation of new treatments for various conditions.<br><br>19. Today transgenic models exist for many human diseases such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer's disease.<br><br>20. Information obtained from transgenic animals includes biological role of factors and studying biological effects that result from gene expression. "],

Transgenic animals can produce useful biological products by introducing the portion of DNA coding for a particular product into their genome.<br><br>3. Human protein α-1-antitrypsin is used to treat emphysema and can be produced using transgenic animals for cost-effective production.<br><br>4. Similar attempts are being made for treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU) and cystic fibrosis using transgenic animal-derived biological products.<br><br>5.

The milk from transgenic cow Rosie contained 2.4 grams per litre of human alpha-lactalbumin protein.<br><br>7. Milk from Rosie was nutritionally a more balanced product for human babies than natural cow-milk due to human alpha-lactalbumin content.<br><br>8. Transgenic mice are being developed for use in testing the safety of vaccines before using them on humans.<br><br>9. Transgenic mice are being used to test the safety of the polio vaccine before human administration.<br><br>10. Transgenic rabbits and monkeys are also used to test the safety of batches of vaccines for quality control purposes.<br><br>11. Chemical safety testing is also known as toxicity testing or safety testing of drugs and toxic substances.<br><br>12. The purpose of toxicity testing is to determine the safety of drugs before they are used for human treatment.<br><br>13. Transgenic animals for toxicity testing are made that carry genes which make them more sensitive to toxic substances than non-transgenic animals.<br><br>14. These sensitive transgenic animals are exposed to the toxic substances and the effects are studied for safety assessment.<br><br>15. Toxicity testing in transgenic animals allows us to obtain results in less time compared to conventional testing methods.<br><br>16. Section 10.4 on Ethical Issues discusses that manipulation of living organisms by humans cannot go on without regulation.<br><br>17. Some ethical standards are required to evaluate the morality of all human activities that might help or harm living organisms.<br><br>18. Genetic modification of organisms can have unpredictable results when such organisms are introduced into the ecosystem.<br><br>19. The Indian Government has set up GEAC (Genetic Engineering Approval Committee) to make decisions regarding validity of GM research.<br><br>20. GEAC makes decisions regarding the safety of introducing GM organisms for public services like food and medicine sources.<br><br>21. The modification and usage of living organisms for public services has raised problems with patents granted for biological resources.<br><br>22.

Population Definition: A population is a group of individuals of the same species mainly sharing or competing for similar resources, potentially interbreeding and thus constitute a real discrete and identifiable unit.<br><br>2. Population Examples: All cormorants in a wetland, rats in an abandoned dwelling, teakwood trees in a forest tract, bacteria in a culture plate and lotus plants in a pond are examples of populations.<br><br>3. Population Attributes: A population has certain attributes that an individual organism does not possess - birth rates, death rates, sex ratio and age distribution.<br><br>4. Birth Rate Calculation: If in a pond there are 20 lotus plants last year and through reproduction 8 new plants are added, the birth rate or natality is 8 divided by 20 equals 0.4 offspring per lotus per year.<br><br>5. Death Rate Calculation: If 3 plants died during the year out of initial 20, the death rate or mortality is 3 divided by 20 equals 0.15 offspring per lotus per year.<br><br>6. Sex Ratio Definition: An individual may be a male or a female but a population has a sex ratio. Example: 60 percent of population are females and 40 percent males gives ratio 60:40 or 3:2.<br><br>7. Age Distribution: Age composition or age distribution is another attribute of a population referring to the percentage of individuals of different age groups.<br><br>8. Age Pyramid: When percentage of individuals of a given age or age group is plotted for the population, the resulting structure is called the age pyramid.<br><br>9. Age Pyramid Shapes: The shape of the age pyramid reflects the growth status - triangular shape indicates expanding population, bell shape indicates stable population, urn shape indicates declining population.<br><br>10.

Age Pyramid Shapes: Figure 13.1 shows three types of age pyramids - expanding (triangular base), stable (bell-shaped) and declining (urn-shaped) indicating growth status of population.<br><br>2. Population Density Symbol: Population size is technically called population density and is designated as N.<br><br>3. Measurement Units: Population density need not necessarily be measured in numbers only. For terrestrial organisms it is measured as individuals per square meter (m²).<br><br>4. Biomass Measurement: In some cases, population density is more meaningfully measured in terms of biomass rather than numbers. Example: A single Banyan tree with large canopy has more biomass than 200 carrot grass plants.<br><br>5. Ecological Significance: The ecological effects of any species depend not merely on its absolute numbers but on how dense it is or on its size in relation to available resources.<br><br>6. Four Basic Processes: Population density in a given habitat during a given period fluctuates due to changes in four basic processes - Natality, Mortality, Immigration and Emigration.<br><br>7. Natality: The total number of births during a given period in a population. It contributes to increase in population density.<br><br>8. Mortality: The total number of deaths during a given period in a population. It contributes to decrease in population density.<br><br>9. Immigration: Number of individuals of the same species that have come into the habitat from elsewhere. It increases population density.<br><br>10. Emigration: Number of individuals of the population who left the habitat and gone elsewhere. It decreases population density.<br><br>11. Population Change Formula: Nt+1 = Nt + [(B + I) - (D + E)], where B is births, I is immigrants, D is deaths and E is emigrants.<br><br>12.

Four Factors Affecting Population: Population density is affected by four basic processes - Natality (B), Mortality (D), Immigration (I), and Emigration (E).<br><br>2. Natality Definition: Natality refers to the number of births during a given period in the population that are added to the initial density. It contributes to increase in population density.<br><br>3. Mortality Definition: Mortality is the number of deaths in the population during a given period. It contributes to decrease in population density.<br><br>4. Immigration Definition: Immigration is the number of individuals of the same species that have come into the habitat from elsewhere during the time period under consideration. It increases population density.<br><br>5. Emigration Definition: Emigration is the number of individuals of the population who left the habitat and gone elsewhere during the time period under consideration. It decreases population density.<br><br>6. Population Density Formula: If N is the population density at time t, then its density at time t + 1 is: Nt+1 = Nt + [(B + I) - (D + E)].<br><br>7. Population Increase Condition: Population density will increase if the number of births plus immigrants (B + I) is more than the number of deaths plus emigrants (D + E).<br><br>8. Normal Conditions: Under normal conditions, births and deaths are the most important factors influencing population density. Immigration and Emigration assume importance only under special conditions.<br><br>9. Special Conditions: If a new habitat is just being colonized, immigration may contribute more significantly to population growth than birth rates.<br><br>10. Zero Growth: If (B + I) = (D + E), then there will be zero population growth and the population will remain stable. "],

The population grows in an exponential or geometric fashion.<br><br>2. Darwin's Observation: Darwin observed exponential growth while developing his theory of natural selection, noting that populations have the ability to grow rapidly when resources are unlimited.<br><br>3. Growth Rate Formula: If birth rate per capita is b and death rate per capita is d, then the rate of change in population dN/dt = (b - d) × N.<br><br>4. Simplified Form: Let (b - d) = r, then dN/dt = rN, where r is the intrinsic rate of natural increase.<br><br>5. Intrinsic Rate (r): The r in the equation is called the intrinsic rate of natural increase and is a very important parameter for assessing impacts of any biotic or abiotic factor on population growth.<br><br>6. r Values Examples: For Norway rat, r = 0.015. For human population in 1981, r value was 0.0205. In 1981, what the current r value is for calculating it, you need to know the birth and death rates.<br><br>7. J-shaped Curve: Exponential growth results in a J-shaped curve when population size (N) is plotted against time. This indicates unlimited resources.<br><br>8. Integral Form Equation: Using integral calculus, the exponential growth equation is Nt = N0 e^rt, where Nt is population after time t, N0 is initial population, r is intrinsic rate, and e is base of natural logarithms (2.71828).<br><br>9. Rapid Growth Potential: Any species growing exponentially under unlimited resource conditions can reach enormous population densities in a short time.<br><br>10. Exponential vs Logistic: When resources are not limiting, growth plot is exponential (J-shaped). When resources are limiting, growth is logistic (S-shaped) with carrying capacity K. "],

Environmental Resistance: Exponentially growing populations ultimately slow down as environmental resistance increases.<br><br>3. S-shaped Growth: When resources are limited, population eventually exhibits S-shaped or sigmoid growth curve.<br><br>4. Four Phases of Logistic Growth: A population growing in a habitat with limited resources shows initially a lag phase, followed by phases of acceleration and deceleration and finally an asymptote.<br><br>5. Asymptote Definition: When the population density reaches the carrying capacity, it reaches asymptote phase. Asymptote is obtained when K equals N.<br><br>6. Verhulst-Pearl Logistic Growth: This type of population growth is called Verhulst-Pearl Logistic Growth and produces a sigmoid curve.<br><br>7. Logistic Growth Equation: The equation is dN/dt = rN[(K-N)/K], where N is population density at time t, r is intrinsic rate of natural increase, and K is carrying capacity.<br><br>8. Carrying Capacity (K): K represents the maximum population size that the environment can sustain indefinitely with available resources.<br><br>9. Growth Limiting Factor: The factor [(K-N)/K] represents the fraction of carrying capacity available for further growth. When N approaches K, this factor approaches zero, slowing growth.<br><br>10. Maximum Growth Rate: In logistic growth, the population growth rate is maximum when N equals K/2, which is the inflection point of the S-shaped curve.<br><br>11. Comparison with Exponential: Unlike exponential growth (J-shaped curve with unlimited resources), logistic growth (S-shaped curve) occurs with limited resources and plateaus at carrying capacity.<br><br>12.

Both host and parasite tend to co-evolve - if host evolves mechanisms for rejecting parasite, the parasite evolves mechanisms to counteract them.<br><br>2. Harm to Host: All parasites harm the host. They may reduce the survival, growth and reproduction of the host and reduce its population density. They might render host more vulnerable to predation.<br><br>3. Ectoparasites: Parasites that feed on the external surface of the host organism are called ectoparasites. Examples: Lice on humans, ticks on dogs, copepods on marine fish.<br><br>4. Endoparasites: Parasites that live inside the host body at different sites (liver, kidney, urinary bladder, alimentary canal, lungs, red blood cells, etc.) are called endoparasites.<br><br>5.

Pyramid of Energy Always Upright: Pyramid of energy is always upright and can never be inverted because when energy flows from a particular trophic level to the next trophic level, some energy is always lost as heat at each step.<br><br>2. Energy Loss at Each Level: At each trophic level, energy is lost through respiration, metabolic activities, heat dissipation, and other processes. Only about 10% energy is transferred to next level.<br><br>3. Unidirectional Energy Flow: Energy flow in an ecosystem is unidirectional.
