Ecology is basically concerned with four levels of biological organisation - organisms, populations, communities and biomes.<br><br>3. In nature, majority of individuals live in groups in a well defined geographical area, share similar resources, potentially interbreed and constitute a population.<br><br>4. A group of individuals resulting from even asexual reproduction is also considered a population for ecological studies.<br><br>5. Examples of populations include cormorants in a wetland, rats in an abandoned dwelling, teakwood trees in a forest tract, bacteria in a culture plate and lotus plants in a pond.<br><br>6. Although an individual organism copes with changed environment, it is at the population level that natural selection operates to evolve desired traits.<br><br>7. Population ecology links ecology to population genetics and evolution.<br><br>8. An individual organism may have births and deaths, but a population has birth rates and death rates.<br><br>9. Birth rates and death rates in a population refer to per capita births and deaths with respect to members of the population.<br><br>10. Birth rate calculation example: If 20 lotus plants produce 8 new plants, birth rate is 8 divided by 20 equals 0.4 offspring per lotus per year.<br><br>11. Death rate calculation example: If 4 individuals in a population of 40 fruitflies died in one week, death rate is 4 divided by 40 equals 0.1 individuals per fruitfly per week.<br><br>12. Sex ratio is an attribute characteristic of a population where an individual is either male or female but population has a sex ratio.<br><br>13. Example of sex ratio: 60 per cent of the population are females and 40 per cent males.<br><br>14. A population at any given time is composed of individuals of different ages.<br><br>15. Age distribution is the per cent individuals of a given age or age group plotted for the population.<br><br>16. The resulting structure of age distribution is called an age pyramid.<br><br>17. For human population, age pyramids generally show age distribution of males and females in a diagram.<br><br>18. The shape of age pyramids reflects the growth status of the population - whether it is growing, stable or declining.<br><br>19. Population attributes include birth rates, death rates, sex ratio and age distribution.<br><br>20. The term interbreeding implies sexual reproduction among population members."],

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Growth models help understand if population growth with time shows specific and predictable patterns.<br><br>2. Resource availability (food and space) is obviously essential for the unimpeded growth of a population.<br><br>3. When resources in the habitat are unlimited, each species has the ability to realise fully its innate potential to grow in number.<br><br>4. Darwin observed the innate potential to grow while developing his theory of natural selection.<br><br>5. When resources are unlimited, the population grows in an exponential or geometric fashion.<br><br>6. In exponential growth, birth rates and death rates are per capita rates, not total numbers.<br><br>7. If birth rate is b and death rate is d, then increase or decrease in N during unit time period t is: dN/dt = (b - d) x N.<br><br>8. If (b - d) = r, then dN/dt = rN.<br><br>9. The r in the equation is called the intrinsic rate of natural increase.<br><br>10. The intrinsic rate of natural increase is an important parameter chosen for assessing impacts of any biotic or abiotic factor on population growth.<br><br>11. For Norway rat, the r value is 0.015.<br><br>12. For flour beetle, the r value is 0.12.<br><br>13. In 1981, the r value for human population in India was 0.0205.<br><br>14. To calculate r value, one needs to know the birth rates and death rates.<br><br>15. The integral form of exponential growth equation is: Nt = N0 ert.<br><br>16. In the equation Nt = N0 ert, Nt is the population density after time t.<br><br>17. N0 is the population density at time zero.<br><br>18. r is the intrinsic rate of natural increase.<br><br>19. e is the base of natural logarithms with value 2.71828.<br><br>20. Exponential or geometric growth pattern results in a J-shaped curve when N is plotted in relation to time (Figure 11.3).<br><br>21.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Parasitism has evolved in so many taxonomic groups from plants to higher vertebrates.<br><br>2. Many parasites have evolved to be host-specific meaning they can parasitise only a single species of host.<br><br>3. Both host and the parasite tend to co-evolve with reciprocal adaptations.<br><br>4. If the host evolves special mechanisms for rejecting or resisting the parasite, the parasite has to evolve mechanisms to counteract and neutralise them.<br><br>5. Parasites evolved special adaptations such as loss of unnecessary sense organs, presence of adhesive organs or suckers to cling on to the host, loss of digestive system and high reproductive capacity.<br><br>6. The life cycles of parasites are often complex, involving one or two intermediate hosts or vectors to facilitate parasitisation of its primary host.<br><br>7. The human liver fluke is a trematode parasite that depends on two intermediate hosts - a snail and a fish - to complete its life cycle.<br><br>8. The malarial parasite needs a vector, the mosquito, to spread to other hosts.<br><br>9. Majority of the parasites harm the host by reducing survival, growth and reproduction of the host and reduce its population density.<br><br>10. Parasites might render the host more vulnerable to predation by making it physically weak.<br><br>11. Parasites that feed on the external surface of the host organism are called ectoparasites.<br><br>12. The most familiar examples of ectoparasites are the lice on humans and ticks on dogs.<br><br>13. Many marine fish are infested by ectoparasitic copepods.<br><br>14. Cuscuta is commonly found growing on hedge plants and has lost its chlorophyll and leaves in the course of evolution.<br><br>15. Cuscuta derives its nutrition from the host plant which it parasitises.<br><br>16. The female mosquito is not considered a parasite although it needs our blood for reproduction.<br><br>17. Endoparasites are those that live inside the host body at different sites like liver, kidney, lungs, red blood cells etc.<br><br>18. The life cycles of endoparasites are more complex because of their extreme specialisation.<br><br>19. The morphological and anatomical features of endoparasites are greatly simplified while emphasising their reproductive potential.<br><br>20. Brood parasitism in birds is a fascinating example of parasitism in which the parasitic bird lays its eggs in the nest of its host and lets the host incubate them.<br><br>21. During the course of evolution, the eggs of the parasitic bird have evolved to resemble the hosts egg in size and colour to reduce the chances of the host detecting them.<br><br>22. Host-specific parasites can parasitise only a single species of host.<br><br>23. Parasites have high reproductive capacity as an adaptation.<br><br>24. Parasites have evolved adhesive organs or suckers to cling on to the host.<br><br>25.

When this same bee pseudocopulates with another Ophrys flower, it transfers pollen to it and thus pollinates the flower.<br><br>22. This demonstrates how co-evolution operates between Ophrys orchid and bee.<br><br>23. If the female bees colour patterns change even slightly during evolution, pollination success will be reduced unless the orchid flower co-evolves to maintain the resemblance of its petal to the female bee.<br><br>24. Figure 11.5 shows orchid floral patterns evolved for attracting pollinators.<br><br>25. The fig-wasp relationship shows tight one-to-one species-specific mutualism and co-evolution."],

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Humus is a dark coloured amorphous substance accumulated during decomposition that is highly resistant to microbial action.<br><br>2. Humus degrades further at an extremely slow rate.<br><br>3. Being colloidal in nature, humus serves as a reservoir of nutrients.<br><br>4. Humus is further degraded by some microbes and release of inorganic nutrients occurs through a process known as mineralisation.<br><br>5. Decomposition is largely an oxygen-requiring process.<br><br>6. The rate of decomposition is controlled by chemical composition of detritus and climatic factors.<br><br>7. In a particular climatic condition, decomposition rate is slower if detritus is rich in lignin and chitin.<br><br>8. Decomposition rate is quicker if detritus is rich in nitrogen and water-soluble substances like sugars.<br><br>9. Temperature and soil moisture are the most important climatic factors that regulate decomposition.<br><br>10. Temperature and soil moisture regulate decomposition through their effects on the activities of soil microbes.<br><br>11. Warm and moist environment favour decomposition.<br><br>12. Low temperature and anaerobiosis inhibit decomposition.<br><br>13. Low temperature and anaerobiosis result in build up of organic materials.<br><br>14. Humus being colloidal acts as a reservoir of nutrients in the soil.<br><br>15. Mineralisation involves the release of inorganic nutrients from humus by microbial degradation.<br><br>16. The chemical composition of detritus determines the rate at which it decomposes.<br><br>17. Lignin and chitin are resistant compounds that slow down decomposition.<br><br>18. Nitrogen-rich and sugar-rich detritus decomposes more quickly than lignin-rich detritus.<br><br>19. Anaerobiosis refers to the absence or lack of oxygen which inhibits decomposition.<br><br>20.

The accelerated rates of species extinctions are largely due to human activities.<br><br>12. There are four major causes of biodiversity losses called The Evil Quartet.<br><br>13. Habitat loss and fragmentation is the most important cause driving animals and plants to extinction.<br><br>14. The most dramatic examples of habitat loss come from tropical rain forests.<br><br>15. Tropical rain forests once covered more than 14 per cent of the earth's land surface but now cover no more than 6 per cent.<br><br>16. By the time you finish reading the chapter, 1,000 more hectares of rain forest would be destroyed.<br><br>17. Rain forest is called the lungs of the planet because it is so huge and produces significant oxygen.<br><br>18. Rain forests are being cut and cleared for cultivating soya beans or for conversion to grasslands for raising beef cattle.<br><br>19. Degradation of many habitats by pollution also threatens the survival of many species.<br><br>20. When large habitats are broken up into small fragments, mammals and birds requiring large territories and animals with migratory habits are badly affected, leading to population declines.<br><br>21. Over-exploitation occurs when need turns to greed.<br><br>22. Humans have always depended on nature for food and shelter."],
