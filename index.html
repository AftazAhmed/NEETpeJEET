Diversity in the biosphere exists at all levels ranging from macromolecules within cells to biomes.<br><br>5. Immense diversity or heterogeneity exists not only at the species level but at all levels of biological organisation.<br><br>6. There are more than 20,000 species of ants present on Earth.<br><br>7. Approximately 3,00,000 species of beetles exist, making them one of the most diverse groups of organisms.<br><br>8.

The rich variety of living organisms never ceases to astonish and fascinate humans.<br><br>11. Ecologists and evolutionary biologists study biodiversity to understand its significance.<br><br>12. Important questions about biodiversity include why there are so many species on Earth.<br><br>13. Scientists investigate whether such great diversity existed throughout Earth's history.<br><br>14.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. The Amazon forest is estimated to produce 20 per cent of total oxygen in earth's atmosphere through photosynthesis.<br><br>2. Pollination is an ecosystem service provided through pollinators like bees, bumblebees, birds and bats.<br><br>3. Without pollination, plants cannot give us fruits or seeds.<br><br>4. Intangible benefits from nature include aesthetic pleasures of walking through thick woods, watching spring flowers in full bloom or waking up to a bulbul's song.<br><br>5. The ethical argument for conserving biodiversity relates to what we owe to millions of plant, animal and microbe species sharing this planet.<br><br>6. Philosophically or spiritually, every species has an intrinsic value even without current or any economic value to us.<br><br>7. We have a moral duty to care for the well-being of all species.<br><br>8. We must pass on our biological legacy in good order to future generations.<br><br>9. In situ conservation means on site conservation where we protect the whole ecosystem.<br><br>10. In situ conservation example is saving the entire forest to save the tiger.<br><br>11. Ex situ conservation means off site conservation outside natural habitats.<br><br>12. Ex situ conservation is desirable when animal or plant is endangered or threatened needing urgent measures.<br><br>13. Endangered or threatened organisms face very high risk of extinction in wild in near future.<br><br>14. Many nations face conflict between development and conservation priorities.<br><br>15. Number of species waiting to be saved exceeds conservation resources available.<br><br>16. Biodiversity hotspots are regions with very high levels of species richness and high degree of endemism.<br><br>17. Endemism means species confined to that region and not found anywhere else.<br><br>18. Initially 25 biodiversity hotspots were identified.<br><br>19. Subsequently nine more biodiversity hotspots were added to the list.<br><br>20. Total number of biodiversity hotspots in the world is 34.<br><br>21. Biodiversity hotspots are also regions of accelerated habitat loss.<br><br>22. Three hotspots cover India: Western Ghats and Sri Lanka, Indo-Burma and Himalaya.<br><br>23. All biodiversity hotspots put together cover less than 2 per cent of earth's land area.<br><br>24. Broadly utilitarian arguments include ecosystem services like oxygen production and pollination.<br><br>25. Conservationists identified biodiversity hotspots for maximum protection."],
