During physical exercise, energy demand increases for maintaining increased muscular activity.<br><br>3. Increased muscular activity during exercise leads to increased supply of oxygen to the muscles.<br><br>4. The increased supply of oxygen necessitates an increase in the rate of respiration, heart beat and increased blood flow via blood vessels.<br><br>5. When physical exercise is stopped, the activities of nerves, lungs, heart and kidney gradually return to their normal conditions.<br><br>6. The functions of muscles, lungs, heart, blood vessels, kidney and other organs are coordinated while performing physical exercises.<br><br>7. The neural system and the endocrine system jointly coordinate and integrate all the activities of the organs so that they function in a synchronised fashion.<br><br>8.

When a stimulus is applied at a site on the polarised membrane, the membrane at that site becomes freely permeable to sodium ions.<br><br>3. Free permeability to sodium ions leads to a rapid influx of sodium ions into the cell.<br><br>4. The rapid influx of sodium ions is followed by the reversal of the polarity of the membrane.<br><br>5. During depolarisation, the outer surface of the membrane becomes negatively charged and the inner side becomes positively charged.<br><br>6. The polarity of the membrane at the site of stimulation is thus reversed and hence the membrane is depolarised.<br><br>7. The electrical potential difference across the plasma membrane at the site of stimulation is called the action potential.<br><br>8. Action potential is in fact termed as a nerve impulse.<br><br>9. At sites immediately ahead of the depolarised region, the axon membrane has a positive charge on the outer surface and a negative charge on its inner surface.<br><br>10. As a result of charge difference, a current flows on the inner surface from site A to site B.<br><br>11. On the outer surface, current flows from site B to site A to complete the circuit of current flow.<br><br>12. Hence, the polarity at the site is reversed and an action potential is generated at the next site.<br><br>13. Thus, the impulse (action potential) generated at one site arrives at the next site.<br><br>14. The sequence is repeated along the length of the axon and consequently the impulse is conducted.<br><br>15. The stimulus-induced permeability to sodium ions is extremely short-lived.<br><br>16. The increased permeability to sodium is quickly followed by a rise in permeability to potassium ions.<br><br>17. Within a fraction of a second, potassium ions diffuse outside the membrane.<br><br>18. The efflux of potassium ions restores the resting potential of the membrane at the site of excitation.<br><br>19. The conduction of nerve impulse involves depolarisation followed by repolarisation of the membrane.<br><br>20. The nerve impulse travels as a wave of depolarisation along the length of the axon."],

Glucose homeostasis in blood is maintained jointly by two hormones: insulin and glucagon.<br><br>5. Prolonged hyperglycemia leads to a complex disorder called diabetes mellitus.<br><br>6. Diabetes mellitus is associated with loss of glucose through urine and formation of harmful compounds known as ketone bodies.<br><br>7. Diabetic patients are successfully treated with insulin therapy.<br><br>8. A pair of testis is present in the scrotal sac outside abdomen of male individuals.<br><br>9. Testis performs dual functions as a primary sex organ as well as an endocrine gland.<br><br>10. Testis is composed of seminiferous tubules and stromal or interstitial tissue.<br><br>11. The Leydig cells or interstitial cells are present in the intertubular spaces of testis.<br><br>12. Leydig cells produce a group of hormones called androgens mainly testosterone.<br><br>13. Androgens regulate the development, maturation and functions of male accessory sex organs.<br><br>14. Male accessory sex organs include epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate gland and urethra.<br><br>15. Androgens stimulate muscular growth, growth of facial and axillary hair, aggressiveness and low pitch of voice.<br><br>16. Androgens play a major stimulatory role in the process of spermatogenesis which is formation of spermatozoa.<br><br>17. Androgens act on the central nervous system and influence the male sexual behaviour called libido.<br><br>18. Androgens produce anabolic or synthetic effects on protein and carbohydrate metabolism.<br><br>19. Females have a pair of ovaries located in the abdomen.<br><br>20. Ovary is the primary female sex organ which produces one ovum during each menstrual cycle.<br><br>21. Ovary also produces two groups of steroid hormones called estrogen and progesterone.<br><br>22. Ovary is composed of ovarian follicles and stromal tissues.<br><br>23. Estrogen is synthesised and secreted mainly by the growing ovarian follicles.<br><br>24. After ovulation, the ruptured follicle is converted to a structure called corpus luteum.<br><br>25. Corpus luteum secretes mainly progesterone hormone.<br><br>26. Estrogens produce wide ranging actions such as stimulation of growth and activities of female secondary sex organs and development of growing ovarian follicles."],

The ovule is a small structure attached to the placenta by means of a stalk called funicle.<br><br>4. The body of the ovule fuses with funicle in the region called hilum.<br><br>5. Hilum represents the junction between ovule and funicle.<br><br>6. Each ovule has one or two protective envelopes called integuments.<br><br>7.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Some plants such as Viola (common pansy), Oxalis, and Commelina produce two types of flowers - chasmogamous and cleistogamous.<br><br>2. Chasmogamous flowers are similar to flowers of other species with exposed anthers and stigma.<br><br>3. Cleistogamous flowers do not open at all.<br><br>4. In cleistogamous flowers, the anthers and stigma lie close to each other.<br><br>5. When anthers dehisce in the flower bud of cleistogamous flowers, pollen grains come in contact with the stigma to effect pollination.<br><br>6. Cleistogamous flowers are invariably autogamous as there is no chance of cross pollen landing on the stigma.<br><br>7. Cleistogamous flowers produce assured seed set even in the absence of pollinators.<br><br>8. Geitonogamy is the transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma of a different flower of the same plant.<br><br>9. Although geitonogamy is functionally cross pollination involving a pollinating agent, genetically it is similar to autogamy since the pollen grains come from the same plant.<br><br>10. Xenogamy is the transfer of pollen grains from anther to the stigma of a different plant.<br><br>11. Xenogamy is the only type of pollination which during pollination brings genetically different types of pollen grains to the stigma.<br><br>12. Plants use two abiotic agents (wind and water) and one biotic agent (animals) to achieve pollination.<br><br>13. Majority of plants use biotic agents for pollination.<br><br>14. Only a small proportion of plants use abiotic agents for pollination.<br><br>15. Pollen grains coming in contact with the stigma is a chance factor in both wind and water pollination.<br><br>16. To compensate for uncertainties and associated loss of pollen grains in abiotic pollination, the flowers produce enormous amount of pollen when compared to the number of ovules available for pollination.<br><br>17. Figure 1.9a shows self-pollinated flowers.<br><br>18. Figure 1.9b shows cross-pollinated flowers.<br><br>19. Figure 1.9c shows cleistogamous flowers.<br><br>20.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. A functional mammary gland is characteristic of all female mammals.<br><br>2. The mammary glands are paired structures called breasts.<br><br>3. Mammary glands contain glandular tissue and variable amount of fat.<br><br>4. The glandular tissue of each breast is divided into 15 to 20 mammary lobes.<br><br>5. Each mammary lobe contains clusters of cells called alveoli.<br><br>6. The cells of alveoli secrete milk which is stored in the cavities or lumens of alveoli.<br><br>7. The alveoli open into mammary tubules.<br><br>8. The tubules of each lobe join to form a mammary duct.<br><br>9. Several mammary ducts join to form a wider mammary ampulla.<br><br>10. The mammary ampulla is connected to lactiferous duct through which milk is sucked out.<br><br>11. Gametogenesis is the process by which gametes are produced in primary sex organs.<br><br>12. The primary sex organs are testis in males and ovaries in females.<br><br>13. Spermatogenesis is the process of sperm formation in testis that begins at puberty.<br><br>14. The immature male germ cells are called spermatogonia.<br><br>15. Spermatogonia are present on the inside wall of seminiferous tubules.<br><br>16. Spermatogonia multiply by mitotic division and increase in numbers.<br><br>17. Each spermatogonium is diploid and contains 46 chromosomes.<br><br>18. Some of the spermatogonia are called primary spermatocytes.<br><br>19. Primary spermatocytes periodically undergo meiosis.<br><br>20. A primary spermatocyte completes the first meiotic division called reduction division.<br><br>21. First meiotic division leads to formation of two equal haploid cells called secondary spermatocytes.<br><br>22. Secondary spermatocytes have only 23 chromosomes each.<br><br>23. Secondary spermatocytes undergo the second meiotic division to produce four equal haploid spermatids.<br><br>24. Spermatids are transformed into spermatozoa or sperms by the process called spermiogenesis.<br><br>25. After spermiogenesis, sperm heads become embedded in the Sertoli cells.<br><br>26. Sperms are finally released from the seminiferous tubules by the process called spermiation.<br><br>27. Spermatogenesis starts at puberty due to significant increase in secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone or GnRH.<br><br>28. GnRH is a hypothalamic hormone.<br><br>29. Increased levels of GnRH act at the anterior pituitary gland and stimulate secretion of two gonadotropins - luteinising hormone or LH and follicle stimulating hormone or FSH.<br><br>30. LH acts at the Leydig cells and stimulates synthesis and secretion of androgens.<br><br>31. Androgens in turn stimulate the process of spermatogenesis.<br><br>32. FSH acts on the Sertoli cells and stimulates spermatogenesis."],

LH and FSH stimulate follicular development as well as secretion of estrogens by the growing follicles.<br><br>3. Both LH and FSH attain a peak level in the middle of cycle at about 14th day.<br><br>4. Rapid secretion of LH leading to its maximum level during the mid-cycle is called LH surge.<br><br>5. LH surge induces rupture of Graafian follicle and thereby the release of ovum called ovulation.<br><br>6. The ovulation or ovulatory phase is followed by the luteal phase.<br><br>7. During luteal phase, the remaining parts of the Graafian follicle transform into the corpus luteum.<br><br>8. The corpus luteum secretes large amounts of progesterone.<br><br>9. Progesterone is essential for maintenance of the endometrium.<br><br>10. Such an endometrium is necessary for implantation of the fertilised ovum and other events of pregnancy.<br><br>11. During pregnancy all events of the menstrual cycle stop and there is no menstruation.<br><br>12. In the absence of pregnancy, the rapture of the endometrium leads to menstruation, marking a new cycle.<br><br>13. In human beings, menstrual cycles cease around 50 years of age and that is termed as menopause.<br><br>14. Cyclic menstruation is an indicator of normal reproductive phase.<br><br>15. Cyclic menstruation extends between menarche and menopause.<br><br>16. During copulation or coitus, semen is released by the penis into the vagina called insemination.<br><br>17. The motile sperms swim rapidly, pass through the cervix, enter into the uterus and finally reach the ampullary region of the fallopian tube.<br><br>18. The ovum released by the ovary is also transported to the ampullary region.<br><br>19. Fertilisation takes place in the ampullary region of fallopian tube.<br><br>20. Fertilisation can only occur if the ovum and sperms are transported simultaneously to the ampullary region.<br><br>21. This is the reason why not all copulations lead to fertilisation and pregnancy.<br><br>22. The process of fusion of a sperm with an ovum is called fertilisation.<br><br>23. During fertilisation, a sperm comes in contact with the zona pellucida layer of the ovum.<br><br>24. The contact induces changes in the membrane that block the entry of additional sperms.<br><br>25. It ensures that only one sperm can fertilise an ovum.<br><br>26. The secretions of the acrosome help the sperm enter into the cytoplasm of the ovum through the membrane and the zona pellucida."],

The umbilical cord helps in the transport of substances to and from the embryo.<br><br>19. Placenta also acts as an endocrine tissue and produces several hormones.<br><br>20. The placenta produces hormones like human chorionic gonadotropin or hCG, human placental lactogen or hPL, estrogens and progestogens.<br><br>21. In the later phase of pregnancy, a hormone called relaxin is also secreted by the ovary.<br><br>22. hCG, hPL and relaxin are produced in women only during pregnancy.<br><br>23. During pregnancy, the levels of other hormones like estrogens, progestogens, cortisol, prolactin and thyroxine are increased several folds in the maternal blood.<br><br>24. Increased production of these hormones is essential for supporting the fetal growth, metabolic changes in the mother and maintenance of pregnancy.<br><br>25.

Awareness of problems due to uncontrolled population growth, social evils like sex-abuse and sex-related crimes enable people to think and take up necessary steps to prevent them and thereby build up a socially responsible and healthy society.<br><br>9. Successful implementation of various action plans to attain reproductive health requires strong infrastructural facilities, professional expertise and material support.<br><br>10. Medical assistance and care should be provided to people in reproduction-related problems like pregnancy, delivery, STDs, abortions, contraception, menstrual problems and infertility.<br><br>11. Implementation of better techniques and new strategies from time to time are required to provide more efficient care and assistance to people.<br><br>12. Statutory ban on amniocentesis for sex-determination was implemented to legally check decreasing female foeticide.<br><br>13. Massive child immunisation is one of the programmes that merit mention in connection with reproductive health.<br><br>14. In amniocentesis some of the amniotic fluid of the developing foetus is taken to analyse the foetal cells and dissolved substances.<br><br>15. Amniocentesis procedure is used to test for the presence of certain genetic disorders such as down syndrome, haemophilia, sickle-cell anaemia and determine the survivability of the foetus.<br><br>16.

Oral administration of small doses of either progestogens or progestogen-estrogen combinations is another contraceptive method used by the females.<br><br>5. Oral contraceptives are used in the form of tablets and hence are popularly called pills.<br><br>6.

Saheli is the new oral contraceptive for the females that contains a non-steroidal preparation.<br><br>11. Saheli is a once a week pill with very few side-effects and high contraceptive value.<br><br>12.

Effective counselling on the need to avoid unprotected coitus and the risk factors involved in illegal abortions as well as providing more health care facilities could reverse the unhealthy trend of illegal MTPs.<br><br>3. Infections or diseases which are transmitted through sexual intercourse are collectively called sexually transmitted diseases STD or venereal diseases VD or reproductive tract infections RTI.<br><br>4. Gonorrhoea, syphilis, genital herpes, chlamydiasis, genital warts, trichomoniasis, hepatitis-B and HIV leading to AIDS are some of the common STIs.<br><br>5. Among the STIs, HIV infection is most dangerous and is discussed in detail in Chapter 7.<br><br>6. Some STIs like hepatitis-B and HIV can also be transmitted by sharing of injection needles, surgical instruments etc with infected persons, transfusion of blood, or from an infected mother to the foetus too.<br><br>7. AIDS and Hepatitis-B are sexually transmitted infections that do not specifically affect reproductive organs.<br><br>8. Except for hepatitis-B, genital herpes and HIV infections, other sexually transmitted diseases are completely curable if detected early and treated properly.<br><br>9. Genital herpes, Hepatitis-B and HIV infection are not completely curable sexually transmitted infections.<br><br>10. Early symptoms of most STIs are minor and include itching, fluid discharge, slight pain, swellings etc in the genital region.<br><br>11. Infected females may often be asymptomatic and hence may remain undetected for long.<br><br>12. Absence or less significant symptoms in the early stages of infection and the social stigma attached to the STIs deter the infected persons from going for timely detection and proper treatment.<br><br>13. Lack of timely detection and proper treatment could lead to complications like pelvic inflammatory diseases PID, abortions, still births, ectopic pregnancies, infertility or even cancer of the reproductive tract.<br><br>14. STIs are a major threat to a healthy society.<br><br>15. Prevention or early detection and cure of STIs are given prime consideration under the reproductive health care programmes.<br><br>16. Though all persons are vulnerable to STIs, their incidences are reported to be very high among persons in the age group of 15-24 years.<br><br>17. Prevention of STIs is possible by following simple guidelines.<br><br>18. To avoid transmission of STIs, one should avoid sex with unknown partners or multiple partners.<br><br>19. To avoid transmission of STIs, one should always try to use condoms during coitus.<br><br>20. In case of doubt regarding STI, one should go to a qualified doctor for early detection and get complete treatment if diagnosed with infection.<br><br>21. A discussion on reproductive health is incomplete without a mention of infertility.<br><br>22.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Based on his observations, Mendel proposed that something was being stably passed down unchanged from parent to offspring through the gametes over successive generations.<br><br>2. Mendel called these things that are passed through gametes as genes.<br><br>3. Genes are the units of inheritance.<br><br>4. Genes contain the information that is required to express a particular trait in an organism.<br><br>5. Genes which code for a pair of contrasting traits are known as alleles.<br><br>6. Alleles are slightly different forms of the same gene.<br><br>7. When using alphabetical symbols for each gene, the capital letter depicts the dominant factor.<br><br>8. The small alphabet letter is used to represent the recessive factor.<br><br>9. In the case of the character of height, T is used for the Tall trait.<br><br>10. The symbol t is used to represent the dwarf trait.<br><br>11. The genotype of a pure tall plant is represented as TT.<br><br>12. The genotype of a pure dwarf plant is represented as tt.<br><br>13. Figure 4.3 shows the diagrammatic representation of a monohybrid cross.<br><br>14. An organism with two identical alleles such as TT or tt is described as homozygous for that trait.<br><br>15. Genotype refers to the genetic makeup of the plant.<br><br>16. The descriptive terms tall and dwarf are the phenotype of the plant.<br><br>17. Phenotype refers to the observable appearance or characteristics of an organism.<br><br>18. Mendel found that the phenotype of the F1 heterozygote Tt was exactly like the TT parent in appearance.<br><br>19. Mendel proposed that in a pair of dissimilar factors, one dominates the other.<br><br>20. The factor that dominates is called the dominant factor.<br><br>21. The factor that is dominated is called the recessive factor.<br><br>22. In the case of height, T for tallness is dominant over t for dwarfness.<br><br>23. Mendel proposed that all the other character or trait pairs that he studied showed identical behaviour.<br><br>24. Using capital letter for dominant and small letter for recessive is a convenient way to remember the concept of dominance and recessiveness.<br><br>25. The genotype Tt represents a heterozygous condition where the organism has dissimilar alleles.<br><br>26. In the heterozygote Tt, the two factors T and t are dissimilar but are alleles of the same gene.<br><br>27. The phenotype of a plant with genotype TT would be tall.<br><br>28. The phenotype of a plant with genotype tt would be dwarf.<br><br>29. The phenotype of a plant with genotype Tt would be tall because T is dominant over t.<br><br>30. Figure 4.3 shows the parental cross between tall and dwarf plants.<br><br>31. In Figure 4.3, all F1 generation plants are tall.<br><br>32. The F1 plants undergo selfing or self-pollination to produce F2 generation.<br><br>33. The F2 generation in Figure 4.3 shows a phenotypic ratio of 3 Tall : 1 Dwarf.<br><br>34. The production of gametes, formation of zygote, F1 and F2 plants can be understood from a diagram called Punnett square."],

From the Punnett square, 1/4th of the random fertilisations lead to TT zygote.<br><br>3. From the Punnett square, 2/4th of the random fertilisations lead to Tt zygote.<br><br>4. From the Punnett square, 1/4th of the random fertilisations lead to tt zygote.<br><br>5. Though the F1 have a genotype of Tt, the phenotypic character seen is tall.<br><br>6. At F2, 3/4th of the plants are tall where some of them are TT while others are Tt.<br><br>7. The remaining 1/4th of the plants in F2 are dwarf with genotype tt.<br><br>8. Within the genotypic pair Tt, only one allele T is enough to express the character of tallness.<br><br>9. T is said to dominate over the other allele t or dwarf character.<br><br>10. It is due to dominance of one gene over the other that all the plants do not appear tall in F1 even though the genotype is Tt.<br><br>11. In F2, 3/4th of the plants are tall though genotypically 1/2 are Tt and 1/4 are TT.<br><br>12. The phenotypic ratio in F2 is 3/4th tall : 1/4th dwarf which gives a 3:1 ratio.<br><br>13. The genotypic ratio in F2 is 1/4 TT + 1/2 Tt : 1/4 tt which gives a 1:2:1 ratio.<br><br>14. The ratio 1/4 : 1/2 : 1/4 of TT: Tt: tt is mathematically condensable to the form TT: 2Tt: tt.<br><br>15. Geneticists like Mendel had to depend solely on bearing genes T or t in equal frequency of 1/2.<br><br>16. The mathematical expression can be expanded as (1/2T + 1/2t)2 = 1/4 TT + 1/2Tt + 1/4tt.<br><br>17. When Mendel self-pollinated the F2 plants, he found that dwarf F2 plants continued to generate only dwarf F3 and F4 progenies.<br><br>18. The genotype of the dwarfs that breed true was homozygous tt.<br><br>19. Though genotypic ratios can be calculated using mathematical probability, by simply looking at the phenotype of a dominant trait, it is not possible to know the genotypic composition.<br><br>20. For example, whether a tall plant from F1 or F2 has TT or Tt composition cannot be predicted from phenotype alone.<br><br>21. To determine the genotype of a tall plant at F2 or F1, the plant has to be crossed with a dwarf plant.<br><br>22. The cross used to determine genotype is called a test cross.<br><br>23. In a typical test cross, an organism showing a dominant phenotype with unknown genotype is crossed with the recessive parent.<br><br>24. In test cross, instead of self-crossing, the organism is crossed with the recessive parent.<br><br>25. The progenies of such a cross can easily and correctly predict the genotype of the test organism.<br><br>26. Figure 4.5 shows the results of a typical test cross.<br><br>27. In the example given, yellow seed colour Y is dominant over white flower y.<br><br>28. Using Punnett square for test cross helps to find out the nature of offspring.<br><br>29.

  }], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. When experiments on peas were repeated using other traits in other plants, sometimes the F1 had a phenotype that did not resemble either of the two parents and was in between the two.<br><br>2. The inheritance of flower colour in the dog flower is a good example to understand incomplete dominance.<br><br>3. Dog flower is also known as snapdragon or Antirrhinum sp.<br><br>4. In a cross between true-breeding red-flowered RR and true-breeding white-flowered rr snapdragon plants, the F1 Rr was pink.<br><br>5. When the F1 pink flowers were self-pollinated, the F2 resulted in the ratio 1 RR Red : 2 Rr Pink : 1 rr White.<br><br>6. In incomplete dominance, the genotypic ratios were exactly as expected in any monohybrid cross.<br><br>7. In incomplete dominance, the phenotype ratios had changed from the 3:1 dominant:recessive ratio.<br><br>8. In snapdragon, R was not completely dominant over r which made the Rr plants pink rather than red.<br><br>9. In incomplete dominance, the R gene can be distinguished as Rr pink from RR red and rr white.<br><br>10. Figure 4.6 shows the results of monohybrid cross in the plant snapdragon where one allele is incompletely dominant over the other allele.<br><br>11. According to Figure 4.6, the phenotypic ratio in F2 generation is red : pink : white = 1:2:1.<br><br>12. According to Figure 4.6, the genotypic ratio in F2 generation is RR : Rr : rr = 1:2:1.<br><br>13. In incomplete dominance, the phenotypic ratio and genotypic ratio in F2 are the same as 1:2:1.<br><br>14. Incomplete dominance is a deviation from Mendelian pattern where F1 shows intermediate phenotype.<br><br>15. To understand what dominance is and why some alleles are dominant and some recessive, we must understand what a gene does.<br><br>16. Every gene contains the information to express a particular trait.<br><br>17. A gene contains information as a pair of alleles.<br><br>18. These two alleles need not always be identical, as in a heterozygous case.<br><br>19. One allele may be different due to some changes that it has undergone which modifies the information that particular allele contains.<br><br>20. The normal allele produces the normal enzyme that is needed for the transformation of a substrate S.<br><br>21. Theoretically, the modified allele could be responsible for the production of the normal or less efficient enzyme.<br><br>22. The modified allele could produce a non-functional enzyme.<br><br>23. The modified allele could produce no enzyme at all.<br><br>24. The P generation in Figure 4.6 shows a cross between Red RR and White rr flowers.<br><br>25. All F1 generation plants in Figure 4.6 have pink flowers with genotype Rr.<br><br>26. The F2 generation in Figure 4.6 shows three phenotypes: red, pink, and white.<br><br>27. In incomplete dominance, heterozygous plants show intermediate phenotype between the two homozygous parents.<br><br>28. The section 4.2.2.1 specifically deals with Incomplete Dominance as a concept.<br><br>29. Incomplete dominance explains the deviation from typical Mendelian 3:1 phenotypic ratio.<br><br>30. The explanation of dominance concept involves understanding gene function and enzyme production."],

Figure 4.7 shows the cross between plants differing in two characters.<br><br>20. Mendel found that seeds resulting from crossing of parents had yellow and round shaped seeds.<br><br>21. In the F1, yellow colour was dominant over green and round shape was dominant over wrinkled.<br><br>22. Both parental dominant traits were expressed in the F1 generation.<br><br>23. These results would be expected if the pattern of inheritance of seed colour were independent of the inheritance of seed shape.<br><br>24. The genotypic symbol Y is used for dominant yellow seed colour.<br><br>25. The genotypic symbol y is used for recessive green seed colour.<br><br>26. The genotypic symbol R is used for round seed shape.<br><br>27. The genotypic symbol r is used for wrinkled seed shape.<br><br>28. The genotype of the parents in dihybrid cross can be written as RRYY and rryy.<br><br>29. RRYY represents round yellow parent and rryy represents wrinkled green parent.<br><br>30. Figure 4.7 shows the genotypes of the parent plants in dihybrid cross.<br><br>31. The gametes for F1 are all RY from one parent and ry from other parent.<br><br>32. Multiple alleles are present at same locus on chromosome.<br><br>33. In a dihybrid cross with 9:3:3:1 ratio, the alleles of two genes are segregating independently."],

In the dihybrid cross Figure 4.7, the phenotypes round yellow, wrinkled yellow, round green and wrinkled green appeared in the ratio 9:3:3:1.<br><br>3. The ratio 9:3:3:1 was observed for several pairs of characters that Mendel studied.<br><br>4. The ratio of 9:3:3:1 can be derived as a combination series of 3 yellow : 1 green with 3 round : 1 wrinkled.<br><br>5. Individual characters when written separately give 3 Round : 1 Wrinkled and 3 Yellow : 1 Green.<br><br>6. The combination (3 Round : 1 Wrinkled)(3 Yellow : 1 Green) = 9 Round Yellow : 3 Wrinkled Yellow : 3 Round Green : 1 Wrinkled Green.<br><br>7. Based on observations on dihybrid cross, Mendel proposed Mendels Law of Independent Assortment.<br><br>8. Dihybrid cross refers to crosses between plants differing in two traits.<br><br>9. The Law of Independent Assortment states that when two pairs of traits are combined in a hybrid, segregation of one pair of characters is independent of the other pair of characters.<br><br>10. The Punnett square can be effectively used to understand the independent segregation of the two pairs of genes during meiosis.<br><br>11. The Punnett square helps understand production of eggs and pollen in the F1 RrYy plant.<br><br>12. Consider the segregation of one gene pair Rr, it will give rise to 50 per cent R and 50 per cent r.<br><br>13. The segregation of 50 per cent R and 50 per cent r is independent from the segregation of 50 per cent Y and 50 per cent y.<br><br>14. 50 per cent of the R bearing gametes have Y and the other 50 per cent has y.<br><br>15. 50 per cent of the r bearing gametes has Y and the other 50 per cent has y.<br><br>16. Therefore the four types of gametes produced are RY, Ry, rY, ry.<br><br>17. There are four types of pollen and four types of eggs produced by F1 RrYy.<br><br>18. Each of the four gametes RY, Ry, rY, ry forms 25 per cent or 1/4th of the total gametes produced.<br><br>19. When four types of sperms and four types of eggs undergo random fusion, they will yield 16 types of zygotes.<br><br>20. It is very easy to derive the composition of the zygotes that give rise to the F2 plants from Figure 4.7.<br><br>21. Different types of genotypes and phenotypes are formed in F2 generation.<br><br>22. Section 4.3.2 deals with Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance.<br><br>23. Mendel published his work on inheritance of characters in 1865.<br><br>24. Mendels work remained unrecognised till 1900.<br><br>25. Mendels work remained unrecognised for several reasons.<br><br>26. Chromosomal theory of inheritance was proposed by Sutton and Boveri.<br><br>27. Law of Independent Assortment is not applicable to linked genes.<br><br>28.

Sutton united the knowledge of chromosomal segregation with Mendelian principles.<br><br>3. This synthesis was called the chromosomal theory of inheritance.<br><br>4. Experimental verification of the chromosomal theory of inheritance was done by Thomas Hunt Morgan and his colleagues.<br><br>5. Morgan worked with tiny fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster.<br><br>6. Figure 4.10 shows Drosophila melanogaster male and female.<br><br>7. Drosophila were found very suitable for genetic studies because they could be grown on simple synthetic medium in the laboratory.<br><br>8. The life cycle of Drosophila is completed in about two weeks.<br><br>9. A single mating of Drosophila could produce a large number of progeny flies.<br><br>10. There was a clear differentiation of the sexes in Drosophila - male and female flies are easily distinguishable.<br><br>11. Drosophila has many types of hereditary variations that can be seen with low power microscopes.<br><br>12. Section 4.3.3 deals with Linkage and Recombination.<br><br>13. Morgan carried out several dihybrid crosses in Drosophila to study genes that were sex-linked.<br><br>14. The crosses were similar to the dihybrid crosses carried out by Mendel in peas.<br><br>15. Morgan hybridised yellow-bodied white-eyed females to brown-bodied red-eyed males and intercrossed their F1 progeny.<br><br>16. Morgan observed that the two genes did not segregate independently of each other.<br><br>17. The F2 ratio deviated significantly from the 9:3:3:1 ratio expected when two genes are independent.<br><br>18. Morgan saw that the genes were located on the X chromosome.<br><br>19. When two genes in a dihybrid cross were situated on the same chromosome, the proportion of parental gene combinations were much higher than the non-parental type.<br><br>20. Morgan called the non-parental type as recombinants.<br><br>21. Linkage is the physical association of genes on a chromosome.<br><br>22. Recombination describes the generation of non-parental gene combinations.<br><br>23. Even when genes were grouped on the same chromosome, some genes were very tightly linked showing very low recombination.<br><br>24. Figure 4.11 Cross A shows tight linkage with very low recombination.<br><br>25. Some genes were loosely linked showing higher recombination.<br><br>26. Figure 4.11 Cross B shows loose linkage with higher recombination.<br><br>27. The genes for white eye and yellow body showed only 1.3 per cent recombination.<br><br>28. White eye and miniature wings showed 37.2 per cent recombination.<br><br>29. Alfred Sturtevant used the frequency of recombination between gene pairs and mapped their position on the chromosome.<br><br>30. Today genetic maps are available for a number of plants and animals including human beings.<br><br>31. Lack of independent assortment in Drosophila is due to linkage.<br><br>32. The frequency of crossing over between any two linked genes is proportional to the distance between them."],

In a large number of insects the mechanism of sex determination is of XO type.<br><br>3. In XO type, all eggs bear an additional X-chromosome besides the autosomes.<br><br>4. In XO type, 50 per cent of sperms bear the X-chromosome whereas the other 50 per cent do not have an X-chromosome.<br><br>5. Eggs fertilised by sperms having an X-chromosome become females.<br><br>6. Eggs fertilised by sperms that do not have an X-chromosome become males.<br><br>7. Due to the involvement of the X-chromosome in the determination of sex, it was designated to be the sex-chromosome.<br><br>8. The chromosomes not involved in sex determination are called autosomes.<br><br>9. Grasshoppers are an example of XO type of sex determination.<br><br>10. In grasshoppers, the male has only one X-chromosome besides the autosomes.<br><br>11. In grasshoppers, females have a pair of X-chromosomes.<br><br>12. In humans, XX-XY type of sex determination is seen.<br><br>13. In humans, both male and female have same number of chromosomes.<br><br>14. Among the 23 pairs of chromosomes in humans, 22 are exactly same in both males and females; these are the autosomes.<br><br>15. In human females, a pair of X-chromosomes is present.<br><br>16.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Section 4.7 deals with Mutation.<br><br>2. Mutation is a phenomenon which results in alteration of DNA sequences.<br><br>3. Mutation consequently results in changes in the genotype and the phenotype of an organism.<br><br>4. In addition to recombination, mutation is another phenomenon that leads to variation in DNA.<br><br>5. Insertion or deletion of one or more base pairs in the DNA results in mutation.<br><br>6. Mutations occur randomly and accidentally.<br><br>7. Mutation may be inherited from parents to offspring.<br><br>8. Loss or gain insertion of one or more base pairs of a segment of DNA result in alteration in chromosomes.<br><br>9. Since genes are located on chromosomes, any change in the sequence of DNA will result in the change in genotype.<br><br>10. Change in genotype results in observable changes at the phenotypic level.<br><br>11. Chromosomal alterations are commonly observed in cancer cells.<br><br>12. Alterations that occur to change in a single base pair of DNA is known as point mutation.<br><br>13. A classical example of point mutation is sickle-cell anaemia.<br><br>14. Deletions and insertions of base pairs of DNA may also produce dramatic effects.<br><br>15. Changes that occur in reading frame are referred to as frame-shift mutations.<br><br>16. External factors that induce mutation are called mutagens.<br><br>17. Section 4.8 deals with Genetic Disorders.<br><br>18. Section 4.8.1 deals with Pedigree Analysis.<br><br>19. The idea that disorders are inherited has been prevalent among human beings since long.<br><br>20. Mendels early work was based on the inheritance pattern of distinct or clear-cut traits.<br><br>21. Almost all human traits showed multiple variations.<br><br>22. Some disorders include haemophilia, cystic fibrosis, sickle-cell anaemia, colour blindness, phenylketonuria, thalassaemia.<br><br>23. An analysis of traits in several generations of a family is called pedigree analysis.<br><br>24. In pedigree analysis, one analyses the inheritance of a particular trait represented in the family tree over generations.<br><br>25. Pedigree analysis helps in analyzing inheritance of species-specific trait, abnormality or disease.<br><br>26. Figure 4.14 shows symbols used in the human pedigree analysis.<br><br>27. In Figure 4.14, male is represented by square symbol.<br><br>28. In Figure 4.14, female is represented by circle symbol.<br><br>29. In Figure 4.14, sex unspecified is represented by diamond symbol.<br><br>30. In Figure 4.14, affected individuals are shown by filled symbols.<br><br>31. In Figure 4.14, mating is shown by line connecting symbols.<br><br>32. In Figure 4.14, mating between relatives is shown by double line.<br><br>33. In Figure 4.14, parents and children are shown by connecting lines.<br><br>34. In Figure 4.14, unaffected offspring are shown by empty symbols.<br><br>35. Pedigree analysis is utilized to trace specific trait, disease or abnormality.<br><br>36. Sickle cell anaemia is an example of point mutation.<br><br>37. In a pedigree when both males and females are affected equally, the trait is most likely autosomal.<br><br>38. Frame-shift mutations are caused by deletions and insertions that change reading frame."],

Under low oxygen tension, haemoglobin undergoes polymerisation causing change in RBC shape from biconcave to sickle-like.<br><br>3. Phenylketonuria is an inborn error of metabolism inherited as autosomal recessive trait.<br><br>4. In Phenylketonuria, the affected individual lacks an enzyme that converts phenylalanine into tyrosine.<br><br>5. As a result, phenylalanine is accumulated and converted into phenylpyruvic acid and other derivatives.<br><br>6. Accumulation of these in brain results in mental retardation.<br><br>7. These derivatives are excreted through urine because of poor absorption by kidney.<br><br>8. Thalassemia is an autosome-linked recessive blood disease.<br><br>9. Thalassemia is transmitted when both partners are unaffected carriers or heterozygous.<br><br>10. The defect in Thalassemia could be due to either mutation or deletion.<br><br>11. Mutation or deletion results in reduced synthesis of one of the globin chains (alpha and beta chains).<br><br>12. In Alpha Thalassemia, production of alpha globin chain is affected.<br><br>13. In Beta Thalassemia, production of beta globin chain is affected.<br><br>14. Alpha Thalassemia is controlled by two closely linked genes HBA1 and HBA2 on chromosome 16.<br><br>15. Beta Thalassemia is controlled by a single gene HBB on chromosome 11 of each parent.<br><br>16.

At the 3 prime-end of polynucleotide chain the sugar has a free OH of 3 prime C group.<br><br>3. The backbone of polynucleotide chain is due to sugar and phosphates.<br><br>4. The nitrogenous bases linked to sugar moiety project from the backbone.<br><br>5. In RNA every nucleotide has an additional OH group present at 2 prime position in the ribose.<br><br>6.

DNA as an acidic substance present in nucleus was first identified by Friedrich Miescher in 1869.<br><br>9. Friedrich Miescher named the acidic substance found in nucleus as Nuclein.<br><br>10. Due to technical limitation in isolating such a long polymer intact the elucidation of structure of DNA remained elusive for a very long period.<br><br>11. In 1953 James Watson and Francis Crick proposed the Double Helix model for the structure of DNA.<br><br>12. Watson and Crick based their model on X-ray diffraction data produced by Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin.<br><br>13. One of the hallmarks of Watson and Crick proposition was base pairing between the two strands of polynucleotide chains.<br><br>14. Erwin Chargaff observed that for a double stranded DNA the ratios between Adenine and Thymine and Guanine and Cytosine are constant and equals one.<br><br>15. The base pairing confers a very unique property to the polynucleotide chains making them complementary to each other.<br><br>16. If the sequence of bases in one strand is known then the sequence in other strand can be predicted.<br><br>17. If each strand from a parental DNA acts as a template for synthesis of a new strand the two daughter DNA produced would be identical to the parental DNA molecule.<br><br>18. Because of the complementary nature of DNA strands the genetic implications of the structure of DNA became very clear.<br><br>19. The Double Helix structure of DNA is made of two polynucleotide chains where the backbone is constituted by sugar-phosphate and the bases project inside.<br><br>20. The two chains of DNA have anti-parallel polarity meaning if one chain has the polarity 5 prime to 3 prime the other has 3 prime to 5 prime.<br><br>21. The bases in two strands are paired through hydrogen bonds forming base pairs.<br><br>22. Adenine forms two hydrogen bonds with Thymine from opposite strand and vice-versa.<br><br>23. Guanine is bonded with Cytosine with three H-bonds.<br><br>24. Always a purine comes opposite to a pyrimidine in DNA base pairing.<br><br>25. The purine-pyrimidine base pairing generates approximately uniform distance between the two strands of the helix.<br><br>26. The two chains of DNA are coiled in a right-handed fashion.<br><br>27.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. In some viruses the flow of information is in reverse direction from RNA to DNA.<br><br>2. The process of synthesis of DNA from RNA template is called reverse transcription.<br><br>3. Reverse transcriptase is the enzyme that synthesizes DNA from RNA template.<br><br>4. The distance between two consecutive base pairs is 0.34 nm or 0.34 × 10⁻⁹ m.<br><br>5. In a typical mammalian cell with 6.6 × 10⁹ bp the total length of DNA is approximately 2.2 metres.<br><br>6. The dimension of a typical nucleus is approximately 10⁻⁶ m.<br><br>7. The length of DNA is far greater than the dimension of a typical nucleus requiring special packaging.<br><br>8. If the length of E. coli DNA is 1.36 mm the number of base pairs in E. coli is approximately 4 million.<br><br>9. In prokaryotes such as E. coli they do not have a defined nucleus.<br><br>10. In prokaryotes the DNA is not scattered throughout the cell but is held in a region termed as nucleoid.<br><br>11. DNA being negatively charged is held with some proteins that have positive charges in the nucleoid.<br><br>12. The DNA in nucleoid is organised in large loops held by proteins.<br><br>13. In eukaryotes DNA packaging organisation is much more complex than prokaryotes.<br><br>14. There is a set of positively charged basic proteins called histones in eukaryotes.<br><br>15. A protein acquires charge depending upon the abundance of amino acid residues with charged side chains.<br><br>16. Histones are rich in the basic amino acid residues lysine and arginine.<br><br>17. Both lysine and arginine amino acid residues carry positive charges in their side chains.<br><br>18. Histones are organised to form a unit of eight molecules called histone octamer.<br><br>19. The negatively charged DNA is wrapped around the positively charged histone octamer to form a nucleosome.<br><br>20. A typical nucleosome contains 200 bp of DNA helix.<br><br>21. Nucleosomes constitute the repeating unit of a structure in nucleus called chromatin.<br><br>22. The nucleosomes in chromatin are seen as beads-on-string structure when viewed under electron microscope.<br><br>23. In a typical mammalian cell with 6.6 × 10⁹ bp and 200 bp per nucleosome approximately 33 million nucleosomes are present.<br><br>24. The beads-on-string structure in chromatin is packaged to form chromatin fibers.<br><br>25. Chromatin fibers are further coiled and condensed at metaphase stage of cell division to form chromosomes.<br><br>26. The packaging of chromatin at higher level requires additional set of proteins.<br><br>27. The association of histone H1 with a nucleosome indicates that DNA is condensed into chromatin fiber.<br><br>28. DNA packaging is essential to fit the long DNA molecule into the small nucleus."],

Some transforming principle transferred from the heat-killed S strain had enabled the R strain to synthesise a smooth polysaccharide coat and become virulent.<br><br>5. The transformation must be due to the transfer of genetic material.<br><br>6. The biochemical nature of genetic material was not defined from Griffith experiments.<br><br>7. Prior to the work of Avery, MacLeod and McCarty (1933-44) the genetic material was thought to be a protein.<br><br>8. Avery, MacLeod and McCarty worked to determine the biochemical nature of transforming principle in Griffith experiment.<br><br>9. They purified biochemicals (proteins, DNA, RNA, etc.) from the heat-killed S cells to see which ones could transform live R cells into S cells.<br><br>10. Avery, MacLeod and McCarty discovered that DNA alone from S bacteria caused R bacteria to become transformed.<br><br>11. Protein-digesting enzymes are called proteases.<br><br>12. RNA-digesting enzymes are called RNases.<br><br>13. Proteases and RNases did not affect transformation so the transforming substance was not a protein or RNA.<br><br>14. Digestion of DNA with DNase did inhibit transformation suggesting that the DNA caused the transformation.<br><br>15. Avery, MacLeod and McCarty concluded that DNA is the hereditary material.<br><br>16. Not everyone was convinced by Avery, MacLeod and McCarty conclusions initially.<br><br>17. DNA is a nucleic acid while DNase is an enzyme that digests DNA.<br><br>18. The unequivocal proof that DNA is the genetic material came from experiments of Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase (1952).<br><br>19. Hershey and Chase worked with viruses that infect bacteria called bacteriophages.<br><br>20. The bacteriophage attaches to the bacteria and its genetic material enters the bacterial cell.<br><br>21. The bacterial cell treats the viral genetic material as if it was its own and subsequently manufactures more virus particles.<br><br>22. Hershey and Chase worked to discover whether it was protein or DNA from viruses that entered the bacteria.<br><br>23. They grew some viruses on a medium that contained radioactive phosphorus and some others on medium that contained radioactive sulfur.<br><br>24. Viruses grown in the presence of radioactive phosphorus contained radioactive DNA but not radioactive protein because DNA contains phosphorus but protein does not.<br><br>25. Viruses grown on radioactive sulfur contained radioactive protein but not radioactive DNA because DNA does not contain sulfur.<br><br>26. Hershey and Chase used radioactive isotopes 32P and 35S in their experiments.<br><br>27. Avery, MacLeod and McCarty were the first scientists to give experimental evidence that DNA is the genetic material through biochemical characterization."],

The presence of thymine at the place of uracil confers additional stability to DNA.<br><br>18. Understanding how thymine provides stability requires knowledge of DNA repair processes studied in higher classes.<br><br>19. Both DNA and RNA are able to mutate.<br><br>20. RNA being unstable mutates at a faster rate than DNA.<br><br>21. Viruses having RNA genome and having shorter life span mutate and evolve faster.<br><br>22. RNA can directly code for the synthesis of proteins hence can easily express the characters.<br><br>23. DNA is dependent on RNA for synthesis of proteins.<br><br>24. The protein synthesising machinery has evolved around RNA.<br><br>25. Both RNA and DNA can function as genetic material.<br><br>26. The criterion that genetic material should not provide scope for changes for evolution is incorrect.<br><br>27.

Taylor experiments proved that DNA in chromosomes also replicate semiconservatively.<br><br>4. The process of DNA replication requires a set of catalysts (enzymes).<br><br>5. The main enzyme is referred to as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase.<br><br>6. DNA polymerase uses a DNA template to catalyse the polymerisation of deoxyribonucleotides.<br><br>7. DNA polymerases are highly efficient enzymes as they catalyse polymerisation of a large number of nucleotides in very short time.<br><br>8. E. coli DNA is 4.6 × 10⁶ bp and divides in 20 minutes with DNA synthesis within 18 minutes.<br><br>9. The average rate of polymerisation has to be approximately 2000 bp per second.<br><br>10. DNA polymerases have to catalyse the reaction with high degree of accuracy.<br><br>11. Any mistake during replication would result in mutations.<br><br>12. Energetically replication is a very expensive process.<br><br>13. Deoxyribonucleosidic triphosphates serve dual purposes - acting as substrates and providing energy for polymerisation.<br><br>14.

The coding strand is displaced during transcription.<br><br>8. The coding strand does not code for anything but is still called coding strand because it has same sequence as RNA.<br><br>9. All reference points while defining a transcription unit is made with coding strand.<br><br>10. The promoter and terminator flank the structural gene in a transcription unit.<br><br>11. The promoter is located towards 5 prime-end (upstream) of the structural gene with respect to polarity of coding strand.<br><br>12. Promoter is a DNA sequence that provides binding site for RNA polymerase.<br><br>13. The presence of a promoter in a transcription unit defines the template and coding strands.<br><br>14. By switching position of promoter with terminator the definition of coding and template strands could be reversed.<br><br>15. The terminator is located towards 3 prime-end (downstream) of the coding strand.<br><br>16. The terminator usually defines the end of the process of transcription.<br><br>17. There are additional regulatory sequences that may be present further upstream or downstream to the promoter.<br><br>18. The properties of promoter shall be discussed while dealing with regulation of gene expression.<br><br>19. A gene is defined as the functional unit of inheritance.<br><br>20. There is no single definition of a gene.<br><br>21. Template strand is also called antisense strand.<br><br>22. Coding strand is also called sense strand.<br><br>23.

RNA polymerase II transcribes precursor of mRNA the heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA).<br><br>4. The primary transcripts contain both the exons and the introns and are non-functional.<br><br>5. Primary transcripts are subjected to a process called splicing where introns are removed and exons are joined in a defined order.<br><br>6. hnRNA undergoes additional processing called as capping and tailing.<br><br>7. In capping an unusual nucleotide methyl guanosine triphosphate is added to the 5 prime-end of hnRNA.<br><br>8. In tailing adenylate residues (200-300) are added at 3 prime-end in a template independent manner.<br><br>9.

The adapter molecule was later identified as tRNA.<br><br>6. tRNA has an anticodon loop that has bases complementary to the codon.<br><br>7. tRNA also has an amino acid acceptor end to which it binds to amino acids.<br><br>8. tRNAs are specific for each amino acid separately.<br><br>9. Another specific tRNA referred to as initiator tRNA is for methionine.<br><br>10. For stop codons there are no tRNAs.<br><br>11. The secondary structure of tRNA looks like a clover-leaf.<br><br>12. In actual structure tRNA is a compact molecule that looks like an inverted L.<br><br>13. Translation refers to the process of polymerisation of amino acids to form a polypeptide.<br><br>14. The order and sequence of amino acids are defined by the sequence of bases in mRNA.<br><br>15. The amino acids are joined by a bond which is known as a peptide bond.<br><br>16. Formation of a peptide bond requires energy which is provided by ATP or GTP.<br><br>17. In the first step of translation amino acids are activated in presence of ATP and linked to their cognate tRNA.<br><br>18. This process is called aminoacylation of tRNA or charging of tRNA.<br><br>19. The process of aminoacylation or charging needs to be more specific because if two charged tRNAs are brought close enough the formation of peptide bond between them would be favored energetically.<br><br>20. The role of tRNA as adapter molecule was assigned much later after the genetic code was postulated."],

  }], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. 99.9 per cent of base sequence among humans is the same.<br><br>2. Assuming human genome as 3 into 10 power 9 bp, there would be differences in 3 into 10 power 6 base sequences.<br><br>3. It is these differences in sequence of DNA which make every individual unique in their phenotypic appearance.<br><br>4. Sequencing the DNA every time to find out genetic differences would be a daunting and expensive task.<br><br>5. DNA fingerprinting is a very quick way to compare the DNA sequences of any two individuals.<br><br>6. DNA fingerprinting involves identifying differences in some specific regions in DNA sequence called as repetitive DNA.<br><br>7. In repetitive DNA sequences, a small stretch of DNA is repeated many times.<br><br>8. These repetitive DNA are separated from bulk genomic DNA as different peaks during density gradient centrifugation.<br><br>9. The bulk DNA forms a major peak during density gradient centrifugation.<br><br>10. The other small peaks are referred to as satellite DNA.<br><br>11. Depending on base composition (A:T rich or G:C rich), length of segment and number of repetitive units, the satellite DNA is classified into many categories.<br><br>12. Satellite DNA is classified into categories such as micro-satellites and mini-satellites.<br><br>13. These sequences normally do not code for any proteins but they form a large portion of human genome.<br><br>14. These sequences show high degree of polymorphism and form the basis of DNA fingerprinting.<br><br>15.

Parasites reproduce asexually in red blood cells, bursting the red blood cells and causing cycles of fever and other symptoms.<br><br>11. After bursting red blood cells, some parasites develop and infect more red blood cells, continuing the cycle.<br><br>12. Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite found in the large intestine of humans.<br><br>13. Entamoeba histolytica causes amoebiasis which is also known as amoebic dysentery.<br><br>14. Symptoms of amoebiasis include constipation, abdominal pain and cramps.<br><br>15. Stools in amoebiasis contain excess mucous and blood clots.<br><br>16. Houseflies act as mechanical carriers in transmission of amoebiasis.<br><br>17. Houseflies serve to transmit the Entamoeba histolytica parasite from faeces of infected person to food.<br><br>18. The Plasmodium life cycle alternates between mosquito host and human host as shown in Figure 7.1.<br><br>19. Sporozoites are the mature infective stages that are stored in mosquito salivary glands and injected during bite.<br><br>20. The bursting of red blood cells by Plasmodium parasites is responsible for the characteristic cycles of fever in malaria."],

Macrophages in tissues can phagocytose and destroy microbes as part of cellular barriers of innate immunity.<br><br>3. Cytokine barriers include virus-infected cells that secrete proteins called interferons.<br><br>4. Interferons protect non-infected cells from further viral infection.<br><br>5. Acquired immunity is pathogen specific, unlike innate immunity.<br><br>6. Acquired immunity is characterised by memory of first encounter with pathogen.<br><br>7. When body encounters a pathogen for the first time, it produces primary response which is of low intensity.<br><br>8. Subsequent encounter with the same pathogen elicits a highly intensified secondary response.<br><br>9. The secondary response is intensified due to the fact that our body appears to have memory of the first encounter.<br><br>10. The primary and secondary immune responses are carried out by two special types of lymphocytes - B-lymphocytes and T-lymphocytes.<br><br>11. B-lymphocytes produce an army of proteins called antibodies in response to pathogens into our blood to fight with them.<br><br>12. T-cells themselves do not secrete antibodies but help B cells to produce them.<br><br>13. Each antibody molecule has four peptide chains - two small called light chains and two longer called heavy chains.<br><br>14. An antibody is represented as H2L2 where H stands for heavy chains and L stands for light chains.<br><br>15. Different types of antibodies are produced in our body including IgA, IgM, IgE and IgG.<br><br>16. Figure 7.4 shows a cartoon representation of an antibody structure.<br><br>17.

Mechanisms of cancer development, treatment and control have been some of the most intense areas of research in biology and medicine.<br><br>3. In our body, cell growth and differentiation is highly controlled and regulated.<br><br>4. In cancer cells, there is breakdown of regulatory mechanisms that control cell growth and differentiation.<br><br>5. Normal cells show a property called contact inhibition by which contact with other cells inhibits their uncontrolled growth.<br><br>6. Cancer cells appear to have lost the property of contact inhibition.<br><br>7. As a result of loss of contact inhibition, cancerous cells just continue to divide giving rise to masses of cells called tumors.<br><br>8. Tumors are of two types - benign and malignant.<br><br>9. Benign tumors normally remain confined to their original location and do not spread to other parts of the body.<br><br>10. Benign tumors cause little damage to the body.<br><br>11. Malignant tumors are a mass of proliferating cells called neoplastic or tumor cells.<br><br>12. Malignant tumor cells grow very rapidly, invading and damaging the surrounding normal tissues.<br><br>13. Malignant tumor cells actively divide and grow and starve normal cells by competing for vital nutrients.<br><br>14. Cells sloughed from malignant tumors reach distant sites through blood.<br><br>15. Wherever sloughed cells get lodged in the body, they start a new tumor there.<br><br>16. The property of spreading to distant sites and starting new tumors is called metastasis.<br><br>17. Metastasis is the most feared property of malignant tumors.<br><br>18. Transformation of normal cells into cancerous neoplastic cells may be induced by physical, chemical or biological agents.<br><br>19. Agents that cause transformation of normal cells into cancer cells are called carcinogens.<br><br>20. Ionising radiations like X-rays and gamma rays cause DNA damage leading to neoplastic transformation.<br><br>21. Non-ionizing radiations like UV cause DNA damage leading to neoplastic transformation.<br><br>22. Chemical carcinogens present in tobacco smoke have been identified as a major cause of lung cancer.<br><br>23. Cancer causing viruses are called oncogenic viruses.<br><br>24. Oncogenic viruses have genes called viral oncogenes.<br><br>25. Several genes called cellular oncogenes or c-onc have been identified in normal cells.<br><br>26. Proto oncogenes are genes in normal cells which when activated under certain conditions could lead to oncogenic transformation.<br><br>27. Early detection of cancers is essential as it allows the disease to be treated successfully in many cases.<br><br>28. Cancer detection is based on biopsy and histopathological studies of the tissue.<br><br>29. Blood and bone marrow tests for increased cell counts are used in case of leukemias.<br><br>30. In biopsy, a piece of the suspected tissue is cut into thin sections, stained and examined under microscope by pathologist.<br><br>31. Examination of stained tissue sections under microscope is called histopathological studies.<br><br>32. Techniques like radiography using X-rays, CT and MRI are very useful to detect cancers of internal organs.<br><br>33. Computed tomography or CT uses X-rays to generate a three-dimensional image of the internal of an organ.<br><br>34.

Sewage treatment is carried out in two stages: primary and secondary treatment.<br><br>3. Primary treatment steps involve physical removal of particles from sewage.<br><br>4. Both large and small particles are removed through filtration and sedimentation.<br><br>5. In primary treatment, floating debris is removed by sequential filtration.<br><br>6. Grit (soil and small pebbles) are removed by sedimentation in primary treatment.<br><br>7. All solids that settle form the primary sludge.<br><br>8. The supernatant forms the effluent after primary treatment.<br><br>9. The effluent from primary settling tank is taken for secondary treatment.<br><br>10. Secondary treatment is also called biological treatment.<br><br>11. Primary effluent is passed into large aeration tanks during secondary treatment.<br><br>12. In aeration tanks, effluent is constantly agitated mechanically.<br><br>13. Air is pumped into aeration tanks during secondary treatment.<br><br>14. This allows vigorous growth of useful aerobic microbes into flocs.<br><br>15. Flocs are masses of bacteria associated with fungal filaments to form mesh-like structures.<br><br>16. Growing microbes consume the major part of organic matter in the effluent.<br><br>17. This significantly reduces the BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) of the effluent.<br><br>18. BOD refers to the amount of oxygen consumed if all organic matter in one litre of water were oxidised by bacteria.<br><br>19. Sewage water is treated till the BOD is reduced.<br><br>20. The BOD test measures the rate of uptake of oxygen by micro-organisms in a water sample.<br><br>21. Indirectly, BOD is a measure of the organic matter present in the water.<br><br>22. The greater the BOD of waste water, more is its polluting potential.<br><br>23. Once BOD is reduced significantly, effluent is passed into a settling tank.<br><br>24. In settling tank, bacterial flocs are allowed to sediment.<br><br>25. This sediment is called activated sludge.<br><br>26. A small part of activated sludge is pumped back into aeration tank as inoculum.<br><br>27. The remaining major part of sludge is pumped into large tanks called anaerobic sludge digesters.<br><br>28. In anaerobic sludge digesters, bacteria grow anaerobically.<br><br>29. These bacteria digest the bacteria and fungi in the sludge.<br><br>30. During digestion, bacteria produce a mixture of gases such as methane, hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide.<br><br>31. These gases form biogas which can be used as source of energy.<br><br>32.

The methodology of microbial sewage treatment has been practiced for more than a century now.<br><br>3. This methodology is practiced in almost all parts of the world.<br><br>4. Till date, no man-made technology has been able to rival the microbial treatment of sewage.<br><br>5. Due to increasing urbanisation, sewage is being produced in much larger quantities than ever before.<br><br>6. The number of sewage treatment plants has not increased enough to treat such large quantities.<br><br>7. Untreated sewage is often discharged directly into rivers leading to their pollution.<br><br>8. Direct discharge of untreated sewage increases water-borne diseases.<br><br>9.

Under these plans, it is proposed to build a large number of sewage treatment plants.<br><br>12. Only treated sewage may be discharged in the rivers under these plans.<br><br>13. Biogas is a mixture of gases containing predominantly methane.<br><br>14. Biogas is produced by the microbial activity and may be used as fuel.<br><br>15. Microbes produce different types of gaseous end-products during growth and metabolism.<br><br>16. The type of gas produced depends upon the microbes and the organic substrates they utilise.<br><br>17.

The enzyme DNA polymerase extends the primers using the nucleotides provided in the reaction and the genomic DNA as template.<br><br>3. If the process of DNA replication is repeated many times, the segment of DNA can be amplified to approximately billion times.<br><br>4. Repeated amplification is achieved by the use of a thermostable DNA polymerase isolated from bacterium Thermus aquaticus.<br><br>5. Thermostable DNA polymerase remains active during the high temperature induced denaturation of double stranded DNA.<br><br>6. The amplified DNA fragment can be used to ligate with a vector for further cloning.<br><br>7. Recipient cells after making them competent can receive and take up DNA present in its surrounding.<br><br>8. If a recombinant DNA bearing gene for ampicillin resistance is transferred into E. coli cells, the host cells become transformed into ampicillin-resistant cells.<br><br>9. If we spread transformed cells on agar plates containing ampicillin, only transformants will grow while untransformed recipient cells will die.<br><br>10. Due to ampicillin resistance gene, one is able to select a transformed cell in the presence of ampicillin.<br><br>11. The ampicillin resistance gene in this case is called a selectable marker.<br><br>12.

The Green Revolution succeeded in tripling the food supply but was still insufficient to feed the growing human population.<br><br>3. Increased yields during Green Revolution were mainly due to improved crop varieties, better management practices, and use of agrochemicals like fertilisers and pesticides.<br><br>4. Agrochemicals are often too expensive for farmers in developing countries limiting their accessibility.<br><br>5. Further increases in yield with existing varieties are not possible using conventional breeding methods alone.<br><br>6. Traditional breeding techniques failed to provide sufficiently fast and efficient systems for crop improvement.<br><br>7. Tissue culture technology was developed during the 1950s when scientists learnt that whole plants could be regenerated from explants.<br><br>8. An explant is any part of a plant taken out and grown in a test tube under sterile conditions in special nutrient media.<br><br>9. Totipotency is the capacity to generate a whole plant from any cell or explant.<br><br>10. The nutrient medium in tissue culture must provide a carbon source such as sucrose along with inorganic salts, vitamins, amino acids and growth regulators.<br><br>11. Growth regulators like auxins and cytokinins are essential components of tissue culture nutrient medium.<br><br>12. Micro-propagation is the method of producing thousands of plants through tissue culture in short durations.<br><br>13. Plants produced through tissue culture are genetically identical to the original plant and are called somaclones.<br><br>14. Important food plants like tomato, banana, and apple have been produced on commercial scale using micro-propagation.<br><br>15. Recovery of healthy plants from diseased plants is an important application of tissue culture method.<br><br>16. Even if a plant is infected with a virus, the meristem including apical and axillary regions remains free of virus.<br><br>17. Virus-free plants can be obtained by removing the meristem and growing it in vitro conditions.<br><br>18. Scientists have succeeded in culturing meristems of banana, sugarcane, and potato for virus-free plant production.<br><br>19. Protoplasts are naked plant cells surrounded only by plasma membranes after digestion of their cell walls.<br><br>20. Scientists have isolated single cells from plants and digested their cell walls to obtain isolated protoplasts.<br><br>21. Isolated protoplasts from two different plant varieties with desirable characters can be fused to get hybrid protoplasts.<br><br>22. Hybrid protoplasts can be further grown to form a new plant with combined desirable traits.<br><br>23. Hybrids produced by protoplast fusion are called somatic hybrids and the process is called somatic hybridisation.<br><br>24. Tissue culture allows propagation of a large number of plants in short durations through micro-propagation technique.<br><br>25.

The choice of cry genes depends upon the crop and the targeted pest as most Bt toxins are insect group specific.<br><br>3. The toxin produced by Bt genes is coded by a gene named cry which stands for crystal protein.<br><br>4. The genes cryIAc and cryIIAb encode proteins that control cotton bollworms.<br><br>5. The gene cryIAb encodes protein that controls corn borer.<br><br>6. There are multiple cry genes for example cryIAc, cryIIAb and cryIAb each targeting specific insect pests.<br><br>7. Several nematodes parasitise a wide variety of plants and animals including human beings.<br><br>8. Meloidogyne incognita is a nematode that infects the roots of tobacco plants and causes a great reduction in yield.<br><br>9. A novel strategy based on RNA interference (RNAi) was adopted to prevent nematode infestation in tobacco plants.<br><br>10. RNAi takes place in all eukaryotic organisms as a method of cellular defense.<br><br>11. RNA interference involves silencing of a specific mRNA due to a complementary dsRNA molecule.<br><br>12. The complementary dsRNA molecule binds to mRNA and prevents translation of the mRNA causing silencing.<br><br>13. The source of complementary RNA in RNAi could be from infection by viruses having RNA genomes or mobile genetic elements like transposons.<br><br>14. Transposons are mobile genetic elements that replicate via an RNA intermediate.<br><br>15. Using Agrobacterium vectors, nematode-specific genes were introduced into the host plant for RNAi-based resistance.<br><br>16. The introduction of DNA was such that it produced both sense and anti sense RNA in the host cells.<br><br>17. The sense and antisense RNA are complementary to each other and form a double stranded RNA (dsRNA).<br><br>18. The double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) initiates RNAi and thus silences the specific mRNA of the nematode.<br><br>19. The consequence of RNAi was that the parasite could not survive in a transgenic host expressing specific interfering RNA.<br><br>20. The transgenic tobacco plant expressing specific interfering RNA prevents survival of Meloidogyne incognita nematode.<br><br>21. RNAi is used as a method to develop pest-resistant plants particularly against nematode infestations.<br><br>22. The mechanism of RNAi provides a targeted approach to control specific pests without affecting other organisms.<br><br>23. Complementary RNA molecules are essential for the RNAi mechanism to function effectively in silencing target genes.<br><br>24. Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer is used to introduce nematode-specific genes for creating transgenic pest-resistant plants.<br><br>25.

Presence of a pathogen is normally suspected only when the pathogen has produced a disease symptom.<br><br>3. By the time symptoms appear, the concentration of pathogen is already very high in the body and is very difficult to capture or eliminate.<br><br>4. At very low concentration of bacteria or virus when symptoms are not yet visible, conventional diagnosis is not possible.<br><br>5. PCR is now routinely used to detect HIV in suspected AIDS patients.<br><br>6. PCR is being used to detect mutations in genes in suspected cancer patients.<br><br>7. PCR is a powerful technique to identify many genetic disorders.<br><br>8. A single stranded DNA or RNA tagged with a radioactive molecule called probe is used for detection.<br><br>9. The probe is allowed to hybridise to its complementary DNA in a clone of cells followed by detection using autoradiography.<br><br>10. The clone having the mutated gene will not appear on the photographic film because the probe will not have complementarity with the mutated gene.<br><br>11. ELISA is based on the principle of antigen-antibody interaction.<br><br>12. Infection by pathogen can be detected by the presence of antigens like proteins and glycoproteins.<br><br>13. Infection by pathogen can also be detected by detecting the antibodies synthesised against the pathogen.<br><br>14. Animals that have had their DNA manipulated to possess and express an extra foreign gene are known as transgenic animals.<br><br>15. Transgenic rats, rabbits, pigs, sheep, cows and fish have been produced.<br><br>16. Over 95 per cent of all existing transgenic animals are mice.<br><br>17.

Transgenic animals help in studying how genes affect the normal functions of the body and its development.<br><br>19.

There are an estimated 200,000 varieties of rice in India alone.<br><br>3. The diversity of rice in India is one of the richest in the world.<br><br>4. Basmati rice is distinct for its unique aroma and flavour.<br><br>5. 27 documented varieties of Basmati are grown in India.<br><br>6. There is a reference to Basmati in ancient texts, folklore and poetry as it has been grown for centuries.<br><br>7. In 1997, an American company got patent rights on Basmati rice through the US Patent and Trademark Office.<br><br>8. The new variety of Basmati has been developed from old Indian farmers varieties.<br><br>9. Indian Basmati was crossed with semi-dwarf varieties and claimed as an invention or a novelty.<br><br>10. The patent extends to functional equivalents, implying that other people selling Basmati rice could be restricted in the US market.<br><br>11. Several attempts have also been made to patent uses, products and processes based on Indian traditional herbal medicines like turmeric and neem.<br><br>12. If patent applications are not countered immediately, other countries or individuals may encash on our rich legacy.<br><br>13. Biopiracy is the term used to refer to the use of bio-resources by multinational companies without proper authorisation and without compensatory payment.<br><br>14. Most industrialised nations are rich financially but poor in biodiversity and traditional knowledge.<br><br>15. The developing and underdeveloped world is rich in biodiversity and traditional knowledge related to bio-resources.<br><br>16. Traditional knowledge related to bio-resources can be exploited to develop modern applications.<br><br>17. Traditional knowledge can also be used to save time, effort and expenditure during commercialisation of bio-resources.<br><br>18. There has been growing realisation of the injustice, inadequate compensation, and benefit sharing between developed and developing countries.<br><br>19. Some nations are developing laws to prevent unauthorised exploitation of their bio-resources and traditional knowledge.<br><br>20. The Indian Parliament has recently cleared the second amendment of the Indian Patents Bill.<br><br>21. The second amendment of Indian Patents Bill takes issues like patent terms, emergency provisions, research and development initiatives into consideration.<br><br>22. Biopiracy involves use of bio-resources by multinational companies and other organisations without proper authorisation from countries and people concerned.<br><br>23. The patent on Basmati rice was an example of biopiracy as it was developed from Indian farmers varieties without proper compensation.<br><br>24. Vigilance is required to immediately counter patent applications that may exploit our traditional knowledge and bio-resources.<br><br>25. Laws are being developed globally to ensure fair compensation and benefit sharing for use of bio-resources and traditional knowledge."],

Ecology can be studied at various levels of biological organization including organisms, populations, communities and biomes.<br><br>3. Population ecology specifically explores ecological processes at the population level.<br><br>4. A population consists of individuals of a species living in a well defined geographical area, sharing or competing for similar resources, and potentially interbreeding.<br><br>5. Although interbreeding implies sexual reproduction, groups formed through asexual reproduction can also be called populations for ecological studies.<br><br>6. Examples of populations include cormorants in a wetland, rats in an abandoned dwelling, teak wood trees in a forest tract, bacteria in a culture plate, and lotus plants in a pond.<br><br>7. Natural selection operates at the population level to evolve desired traits, even though individual organisms must cope with environmental changes.<br><br>8. Population ecology is important because it links ecology to population genetics and evolution.<br><br>9. A population has certain attributes that an individual organism does not possess.<br><br>10. An individual may have births and deaths, but a population has birth rates and death rates.<br><br>11. Birth rates and death rates in a population refer to per capita births and deaths respectively.<br><br>12. Population rates are expressed as changes in numbers with respect to members of the population.<br><br>13. Birth rate calculation example: If 20 lotus plants produced 8 new plants, the birth rate is 8 divided by 20 equals 0.4 offspring per lotus per year.<br><br>14. Death rate calculation example: If 4 out of 40 fruitflies died in one week, the death rate is 4 divided by 40 equals 0.1 individuals per fruitfly per week.<br><br>15. Sex ratio is a population attribute that indicates the proportion of males and females in the population.<br><br>16. An individual can be either male or female, but a population has a sex ratio such as 60 per cent females and 40 per cent males.<br><br>17. A population at any given time is composed of individuals of different ages.<br><br>18. Age distribution is plotted as per cent individuals of a given age or age group for the population.<br><br>19.

Three types of age pyramids represent population status: expanding, stable, and declining populations.<br><br>3. An expanding age pyramid has a large pre-reproductive base indicating population growth.<br><br>4. A stable age pyramid shows relatively equal distribution among different age groups.<br><br>5. A declining age pyramid has a small pre-reproductive base compared to older age groups.<br><br>6. The size of a population tells us a lot about its status in the habitat.<br><br>7. All ecological processes in a population are evaluated in terms of changes in population size.<br><br>8. Population size in nature can be as low as less than 10 like Siberian cranes at Bharatpur wetlands or go into millions like Chlamydomonas in a pond.<br><br>9. Population size is technically called population density and designated as N.<br><br>10. Population density need not necessarily be measured in numbers only.<br><br>11. Total number is generally the most appropriate measure of population density but can be meaningless or difficult to determine in some cases.<br><br>12. When comparing 200 carrot grass (Parthenium hysterophorus) plants with a single huge banyan tree, stating banyan density is low underestimates the enormous role of the banyan.<br><br>13. Per cent cover or biomass is a more meaningful measure of population size when number-based density is inadequate.<br><br>14. Total number is not an easily adoptable measure if the population is huge and counting is impossible or very time-consuming.<br><br>15. For dense laboratory culture of bacteria in a petri dish, density is the best measure to report.<br><br>16. For certain ecological investigations, there is no need to know absolute population densities; relative densities serve the purpose equally well.<br><br>17. Number of fish caught per trap is good enough measure of total population density in a lake.<br><br>18. Population sizes are mostly estimated indirectly without actually counting or seeing them.<br><br>19. Tiger census in national parks and tiger reserves is often based on pug marks and fecal pellets.<br><br>20. The size of a population for any species is not a static parameter and keeps changing with time.<br><br>21. Population size changes depend on various factors including food availability, predation pressure and adverse weather.<br><br>22. Changes in population density give us some idea of what is happening in the population - whether it is flourishing or declining.<br><br>23.

  }], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Table 11.1 shows six types of population interactions based on the effects on Species A and Species B.<br><br>2. When both Species A and B show plus sign, the interaction is mutualism where both species benefit.<br><br>3. When both Species A and B show minus sign, the interaction is competition where both species lose.<br><br>4. When Species A shows plus and Species B shows minus, the interaction is either predation or parasitism.<br><br>5. In predation, the predator benefits and the prey is harmed.<br><br>6. In parasitism, the parasite benefits and the host is harmed.<br><br>7. When Species A shows plus and Species B shows zero, the interaction is commensalism.<br><br>8. In commensalism, one species is benefitted and the other is neither benefitted nor harmed.<br><br>9. When Species A shows minus and Species B shows zero, the interaction is amensalism.<br><br>10. In amensalism, one species is harmed whereas the other is unaffected.<br><br>11. Both species benefit in mutualism and both lose in competition in their interactions with each other.<br><br>12. In both parasitism and predation, only one species benefits (parasite and predator respectively) and the interaction is detrimental to the other species (host and prey respectively).<br><br>13. Predation, parasitism and commensalism share a common characteristic: the interacting species live closely together.<br><br>14. Predation can be thought of as nature's way of transferring to higher trophic levels the energy fixed by plants.<br><br>15. When we think of predator and prey, probably it is the tiger and the deer that readily come to our mind.<br><br>16. A sparrow eating any seed is no less a predator than a tiger eating deer.<br><br>17. Although animals eating plants are categorised separately as herbivores, they are in a broad ecological context not very different from predators.<br><br>18. Besides acting as conduits for energy transfer across trophic levels, predators play other important roles.<br><br>19. Predators keep prey populations under control.<br><br>20. Without predators, prey species could achieve very high population densities and cause ecosystem instability.<br><br>21. When certain exotic species are introduced into a geographical area, they become invasive and start spreading fast because the invaded land does not have its natural predators.<br><br>22. The prickly pear cactus introduced into Australia in the early 1920's caused havoc by spreading rapidly into millions of hectares of rangeland.<br><br>23. The invasive prickly pear cactus was brought under control only after a cactus-feeding predator (a moth) from its natural habitat was introduced into the country.<br><br>24.

When resources are limited, the competitively superior species will eventually eliminate the other species.<br><br>6. Evidence for competitive exclusion occurring in nature is not always conclusive, but strong and persuasive circumstantial evidence does exist in some cases.<br><br>7. The Abingdon tortoise in Galapagos Islands became extinct within a decade after goats were introduced on the island, apparently due to the greater browsing efficiency of the goats.<br><br>8. Another evidence for the occurrence of competition in nature comes from what is called competitive release.<br><br>9. A species whose distribution is restricted to a small geographical area because of the presence of a competitively superior species, is found to expand its distributional range dramatically when the competing species is experimentally removed.<br><br>10. Connell's elegant field experiments showed that on the rocky sea coasts of Scotland, the larger and competitively superior barnacle Balanus dominates the intertidal area, and excludes the smaller barnacle Chathamalus from that zone.<br><br>11. In general, herbivores and plants appear to be more adversely affected by competition than carnivores.<br><br>12. Gause's Competitive Exclusion Principle states that two closely related species competing for the same resources cannot co-exist indefinitely and the competitively inferior one will be eliminated eventually.<br><br>13. Gause's Competitive Exclusion Principle may be true if resources are limiting, but not otherwise.<br><br>14. More recent studies do not support such gross generalisations about competition.<br><br>15. While recent studies do not rule out the occurrence of interspecific competition in nature, they point out that species facing competition might evolve mechanisms that promote co-existence rather than exclusion.<br><br>16. One such mechanism for co-existence is resource partitioning.<br><br>17. If two species compete for the same resource, they could avoid competition by choosing, for instance, different times for feeding or different foraging patterns.<br><br>18. MacArthur showed that five closely related species of warblers living on the same tree were able to avoid competition and co-exist due to behavioural differences in their foraging activities.<br><br>19. Considering that the parasitic mode of life ensures free lodging and meals, it is not surprising that parasitism has evolved."],

Plants need the help of animals for pollinating their flowers and dispersing their seeds.<br><br>3. Animals obviously have to be paid fees for the services that plants expect from them.<br><br>4. Plants offer rewards or fees in the form of pollen and nectar for pollinators and juicy and nutritious fruits for seed dispersers.<br><br>5. The mutually beneficial system should also be safeguarded against cheaters, for example, animals that try to steal nectar without aiding in pollination.<br><br>6. Plant-animal interactions often involve co-evolution of the mutualists, that is, the evolutions of the flower and its pollinator species are tightly linked with one another.<br><br>7. In many species of fig trees, there is a tight one-to-one relationship with the pollinator species of wasp as shown in Figure 11.4.<br><br>8. A given fig species can be pollinated only by its partner wasp species and no other species.<br><br>9. The female wasp uses the fruit not only as an oviposition (egg-laying) site but uses the developing seeds within the fruit for nourishing its larvae.<br><br>10. The wasp pollinates the fig inflorescences while searching for suitable egg-laying sites.<br><br>11.

Primary production is expressed in terms of weight (g m-2) or energy (kcal m-2).<br><br>3. The rate of biomass production is called productivity and is expressed in terms of g m-2 yr-1 or (kcal m-2) yr-1 to compare productivity of different ecosystems.<br><br>4. Productivity can be divided into gross primary productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP).<br><br>5. Gross primary productivity of an ecosystem is the rate of production of organic matter during photosynthesis.<br><br>6. A considerable amount of GPP is utilised by plants in respiration.<br><br>7. Gross primary productivity minus respiration losses (R) is the net primary productivity (NPP). Formula: GPP - R = NPP.<br><br>8. Net primary productivity is the available biomass for the consumption to heterotrophs (herbivores and decomposers).<br><br>9. Secondary productivity is defined as the rate of formation of new organic matter by consumers.<br><br>10. Primary productivity depends on the plant species inhabiting a particular area.<br><br>11. Primary productivity depends on variety of environmental factors, availability of nutrients and photosynthetic capacity of plants.<br><br>12. Primary productivity varies in different types of ecosystems.<br><br>13. The annual net primary productivity of the whole biosphere is approximately 170 billion tons (dry weight) of organic matter.<br><br>14. Despite occupying about 70 per cent of the surface, the productivity of the oceans are only 55 billion tons.<br><br>15. Decomposers break down complex organic matter into inorganic substances like carbon dioxide, water and nutrients and the process is called decomposition.<br><br>16. Dead plant remains such as leaves, bark, flowers and dead remains of animals including fecal matter constitute detritus.<br><br>17. Detritus is the raw material for decomposition.<br><br>18. The important steps in the process of decomposition are fragmentation, leaching, catabolism, humification and mineralisation.<br><br>19. Detritivores (e.g., earthworm) break down detritus into smaller particles and this process is called fragmentation.<br><br>20. By the process of leaching, water-soluble inorganic nutrients go down into the soil horizon and get precipitated as unavailable salts.<br><br>21. Bacteria and fungal enzymes degrade detritus into simpler inorganic substances and this process is called catabolism.<br><br>22. All the steps in decomposition operate simultaneously on the detritus.<br><br>23. Humification and mineralisation occur in the soil.<br><br>24.

DFC is made up of decomposers which are heterotrophic organisms, mainly fungi and bacteria.<br><br>3. Decomposers meet their energy and nutrient requirements by degrading dead organic matter or detritus.<br><br>4. Decomposers are also known as saprotrophs (sapro means to decompose).<br><br>5. Decomposers secrete digestive enzymes that breakdown dead and waste materials into simple inorganic materials.<br><br>6. The simple inorganic materials produced by decomposers are subsequently absorbed by them.<br><br>7. In an aquatic ecosystem, GFC (Grazing Food Chain) is the major conduit for energy flow.<br><br>8. In a terrestrial ecosystem, a much larger fraction of energy flows through the detritus food chain than through the GFC.<br><br>9. Detritus food chain may be connected with the grazing food chain at some levels.<br><br>10. Some of the organisms of DFC are prey to the GFC animals.<br><br>11. In a natural ecosystem, some animals like cockroaches, crows, etc., are omnivores.<br><br>12. The natural interconnection of food chains make it a food web.<br><br>13. Organisms occupy a place in the natural surroundings or in a community according to their feeding relationship with other organisms.<br><br>14. Based on the source of their nutrition or food, organisms occupy a specific place in the food chain known as their trophic level.<br><br>15. Producers belong to the first trophic level.<br><br>16.

Within a region, species richness increased with increasing explored area, but only up to a limit.<br><br>10. The relation between species richness and area for a wide variety of taxa turns out to be a rectangular hyperbola.<br><br>11. The taxa for which this relationship was observed include angiosperm plants, birds, bats, and freshwater fishes.<br><br>12. On a logarithmic scale, the species-area relationship is a straight line described by the equation log S = log C + Z log A.<br><br>13. In the species-area equation, S represents species richness.<br><br>14. In the species-area equation, A represents area.<br><br>15. In the species-area equation, Z represents the slope of the line or regression coefficient.<br><br>16. In the species-area equation, C represents the Y-intercept.<br><br>17. Ecologists have discovered that the value of Z is in the range of 0.1 to 0.2.<br><br>18. The Z value of 0.1 to 0.2 holds regardless of the taxonomic group or the region.<br><br>19. The slopes of the regression line are amazingly similar whether it is plants in Britain, birds in California, or molluscs in New York state.<br><br>20. If species-area relationships are analysed among very large areas like entire continents, the slope of the line is much steeper.<br><br>21. For entire continents, Z values are in the range of 0.6 to 1.2.<br><br>22. For frugivorous (fruit-eating) birds and mammals in the tropical forests of different continents, the slope is found to be 1.15.<br><br>23. Steeper slopes in species-area relationships mean a faster increase in species richness with increasing area.<br><br>24. The question of whether the number of species in a community really matters to ecosystem functioning is important.<br><br>25. Ecologists have not been able to give a definitive answer to the importance of species diversity to ecosystem functioning.<br><br>26. For many decades, ecologists believed that communities with more species generally tend to be more stable than those with less species."],

Ecologists warn that if present trends continue nearly half of all the species on earth might be wiped out within the next 100 years.<br><br>14. Loss of biodiversity in a region may lead to decline in plant production.<br><br>15. Loss of biodiversity may lead to lowered resistance to environmental perturbations such as drought.<br><br>16. Loss of biodiversity may lead to increased variability in certain ecosystem processes such as plant productivity, water use, and pest and disease cycles.<br><br>17. The accelerated rates of species extinctions that the world is facing now are largely due to human activities.<br><br>18. There are four major causes of biodiversity losses collectively called The Evil Quartet.<br><br>19. Habitat loss and fragmentation is the most important cause driving animals and plants to extinction among the Evil Quartet.<br><br>20. The most dramatic examples of habitat loss come from tropical rain forests.<br><br>21. Tropical rain forests once covered more than 14 per cent of the earth's land surface.<br><br>22. Tropical rain forests now cover no more than 6 per cent of the earth's land surface.<br><br>23. Tropical rain forests are being destroyed fast.<br><br>24. By the time you finish reading the chapter on biodiversity 1,000 more hectares of rain forest would have been lost.<br><br>25. The Amazon rain forest is so huge that it is called the lungs of the planet.<br><br>26. The Amazon rain forest harbouring probably millions of species is being cut and cleared for cultivating soya beans.<br><br>27. The Amazon rain forest is also being converted to grasslands for raising beef cattle.<br><br>28. Besides total loss the degradation of many habitats by pollution also threatens the survival of many species.<br><br>29. When large habitats are broken up into small fragments due to various human activities mammals and birds requiring large territories are badly affected.<br><br>30. Habitat fragmentation badly affects certain animals with migratory habits leading to population declines.<br><br>31. Over-exploitation is the second major cause in the Evil Quartet.<br><br>32. Humans have always depended on nature for food and shelter but when need turns to greed it leads to over-exploitation."],
